</div><p class="dropcap">h! my dear Donald, what good stories you
told me in the few months that I had the
pleasure of passing with you! How you
stuffed and saturated me with them!</p>

<p>And the English pretend that nobody laughs in
Scotland!</p>

<p>Don't they though! and with the right sort of
laughter, too: a laugh that is frank, and full of
<i>finesse</i> and good-humour.</p>

<p>You will be astonished, perhaps, that a three or
four months' sojourn in Scotland should permit me
to write a little volume on your dear country, and
you will, may be, accuse me of having visited you
with the idea of seeking two hundred pages for
the printer.</p>

<p>You would be very wrong in your impression, if
you thought so.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, I did not take a single note in
Scotland; but, on my return home, all those<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 2]</span>
delicious anecdotes came back to my memory,
and I could not resist the temptation of telling a
few of them to my compatriots.</p>

<p>After all, Scotland is almost a closed letter to
the French; and I thought I might make myself
useful and agreeable in offering French readers a
picture of the manners and character of the
Caledonians.</p>

<p>If, in order to be a success, a book of travels
must be full of the strange and the horrible, it is
all up with this one. But such is not the case;
and he who advanced this opinion calumniated the
public.</p>

<p>I have as much right as anyone to contradict
such an assertion; for the public has been pleased
to give the kindest reception to my books on
England, and I certainly never had any other aim
or ambition than that of telling the truth according
to Horace's principle, <i>Ridentem dicere verum quid
vetat</i>?</p>

<p>Scotland is perhaps the only country whose
anecdotes alone would suffice to give an exact
idea of her inhabitants.</p>

<p>Irish anecdotes are exceedingly droll; but they
only tend to show the thoughtless side of the
Irish character. They are very amusing bulls;
but while they divert, they do not instruct.</p>

<p>In Scotland, on the contrary, you find in the
anecdotes a picture of the Scotch manners and
character, as complete as it is faithful.</p>

<p>The Scot has kept the characteristics of his<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3]</span>
ancestors; but his manners have been toned
down, and the language he speaks is growing
more and more English: he is a changed man,
and, in good society, you might be puzzled to tell
him from an Englishman.</p>

<p>This is not a compliment, for he has no desire to
pass for other than Scotch.</p>

<p>Among those characteristics, there are two which
he has preserved intact to the present day: <i>finesse</i>
and matter-of-fact good-humour. You will find
these two traits in every grade of Scotch life&mdash;in
tradesman, mechanic, and peasant.</p>

<p>This is why, setting aside the upper classes, the
Scotch differ essentially from the English.</p>

<p>It is because of that good-humour that the Scot
is more communicative than the Englishman. He
knows his failings, and does not mind talking about
them; in fact, he will give you anecdotes to illustrate
them, and this because they are national,
and he loves to dwell on anything which reminds
him that Scotland is a nation.</p>

<p>I might have entitled this volume, "The Scotch
painted by themselves," for I do but write down
what I saw and heard. I owe the scenes of life I
describe to the Scotch who enacted them before
me, and the anecdotes to those who were kind
enough to tell them to me.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 4]</span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 42px;">
<img src="images/capi.jpg" width="42" height="80" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><p class="dropcap">n the eyes of the French, the Scot is a
British subject&mdash;in other words, an Englishman&mdash;dressed
in a Tam-o'-Shanter, a plaid,
and kilt of red and green tartan, and playing the
bagpipes; for the rest, speaking English, eating
roast beef, and swearing by the Bible.</p>

<p>For that matter, many English people are pleased
to entertain the same illusions on the subject of
the dwellers in the north of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Yet, never were two nations<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> so near on the
map, and so far removed in their ways and character.</p>

<p>The Scots English! Well, just advance that
opinion in the presence of one, and you will see
how it will be received.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>The Scotchman is a British subject; but if you
take him for an Englishman, he draws himself up,
and says:</p>

<p>"No, Sir; I am not English. I am a Scotchman."</p>

<p>He is Scotch, and he intends to remain Scotch.
He is proud of his nationality, and I quite understand
it.</p>

<p>Of all the inhabitants of the more-or-less-United
Kingdom, Friend Donald is the most keen,
sturdy, matter-of-fact, persevering, industrious,
and witty.</p>

<p>The most witty! Now I have said something.</p>

<p>Yes, the most witty, with all due respect to the
shade of Sydney Smith.</p>

<p>So little do the English know the Scotch, that
when I spoke to them of my intention to lecture
in Scotland, they laughed at me.</p>

<p>"But don't you know, my dear fellow," they
exclaimed, "that it is only by means of a pickaxe
that you can get a joke into the skull of a Scotchman?"</p>

<p>And the fact is, that since the day when Sydney
Smith, of jovial memory, pronounced his famous
dictum, that it required a surgical operation to
make a Scotchman understand a joke, poor Donald
has been powerless to prevent past and present
generations from repeating the phrase of the
celebrated wit.</p>

<p>All in vain did Scotland produce Smollett,
Robert Burns, Walter Scott, and Thomas Carlyle,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 6]</span>
in the eyes of the English, the Scotchman has
remained the personification of slow-wittedness&mdash;a
poor fellow incapable of making much beyond
prayers and money, and the Londoner who has
never travelled&mdash;the poor Cockney who still firmly
believes that the French are feeble creatures, living
on snails and frogs&mdash;this Londoner, the most
stupid animal in the world (after the Paris <i>badaud</i>,
perhaps), goes about repeating to all who will listen
to such nonsense:</p>

<p>"Dull and heavy as a Scotchman!"</p>

<p>Give a few minutes' start to a hoax, and you
will never be able to overtake it.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, the wit of, I will not say, an
Englishman, but a Cockney, is not within the reach
of the Scot. Jokes, play upon words, and bantering
are not in his line. A pun will floor him
completely; but I hope to be able to prove, by
means of a few anecdotes, that Donald has real
wit, and humour above all&mdash;humour of the light,
subtle kind, that would pass by a Cockney without
making the least impression.</p>

<p>I do not wish to say that there is more intelligence
in Scotland than in England; but I can in
all security say there is more intellectuality.</p>

<p>The Cockney must have his puns and small
jokes. On the stage, he delights in jigs; and to
really please him, the best of actors have to become
rivals of the mountebanks at a fair. A hornpipe
delights his heart. An actor who, for an
hour together, pretends not to be able to keep on<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 7]</span>
his hat, sends him into the seventh heaven of delight;
and I have seen the tenants of the stalls
applaud these things. Such performances make
the Scotch smile, but with pity. The Cockney!
When you have said that you have said everything:
it is a being who will find fault with the
opera of <i>Faust</i>, because up to the present time no
manager has given the Kermess scene the attraction
of an acrobat turning a wheel or standing on his
head.</p>

<p>No, no; the Scotchman has no wit of this sort.
In the matter of wit, he is an epicure, and only
appreciates dainty food. A smart repartee will
tickle his sides agreeably; he understands <i>demi-mots</i>;
he is good-tempered, and can take a joke as
well as see through one. His quick-wittedness
and the subtlety of his character make him full of
quaint remarks and funny and unexpected comparisons.
He is a stranger to affectation&mdash;that
dangerous rock to the would-be wit; he is natural,
and is witty without trying to be a wit.</p>

<p>Yes, Donald is witty; but he possesses more
solid qualities as well.</p>

<p>We will make acquaintance with his intellectual
qualities presently.</p>

<p>As to his exterior&mdash;look at him: he is as strong
as his own granite, and cut out for work.</p>

<p>A head well planted on a pair of broad shoulders;
a strong-knit, sinewy frame; small, keen eyes;
iron muscles; a hand that almost crushes your
own as he shakes it; and large flat feet that only<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 8]</span>
advance cautiously and after having tried the
ground: such is Donald.</p>

<p>Needless to say that he generally lives to a good
old age.</p>

<p>I never knew a Christian so confident of going to
Paradise, or less eager to set out.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Why does the Scotchman succeed everywhere?
Why, in Australia, New Zealand, and all the other
British Colonies, do you find him landowner,
director of companies, at the head of enterprises
of all kinds? Again, why do you find in almost all
the factories of Great Britain that the foreman is
Scotch?</p>

<p>Ah! it is very simple.</p>

<p>Success is very rarely due to extraordinary circumstances,
or to chance, as the social failures are
fond of saying.</p>

<p>The Scot is economical, frugal, matter-of-fact,
exact, thoroughly to be depended upon, persevering,
and hard-working.</p>

<p>He is an early riser; when he earns but half-a-crown
a day, he puts by sixpence or a shilling; he
minds his own business, and does not meddle with
other people's.</p>

<p>Add to these qualities the body that I was
speaking of&mdash;a body healthy, bony, robust, and
rendered impervious to fatigue by the practice of
every healthful exercise&mdash;and you will understand
why the Scotch succeed everywhere.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>His religion teaches him to trust in God, and to
rely upon his own resources&mdash;an eminently practical
religion, whose device is:</p>

<p><i>Help yourself and Heaven will help you.</i></p>

<p>If a Scotchman were wrecked near an outlandish
island in Oceania, I guarantee that you will find
him, a few years later, installed as a landed proprietor,
exacting rents and taxes from the natives.</p>

<p>Where the English, the Irish especially, will
starve, the Scotch will exist; where the English
can exist, the Scotch will dine.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The following little scene, which took place in
my house, enlightened me very much as to why one
finds the Scotch farming their own land in the
colonies, while the Irish are doing labourers' work.</p>

<p>I had an Irish cook, an honest woman if ever
there was one, faithful, and of a religion as sincere
as it was unpractical.</p>

<p>The housemaid, a true-born Scotch girl, came
down one morning to find the poor cook on her
knees in the act of imploring Heaven to make her
fire burn.</p>

<p>"But your wood is damp," she exclaimed;
"how can ye expect it to burn? Pray, if ye will,
but the Lord has a muckle to mind; and ye'd do
weel to pit your wood in the oven o' nights, instead
of bothering Him wi' such trifles."</p>

<p>"It was faith, nevertheless," said a worthy lady,
to whom I told the matter.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>It was idleness, thought I, or very much like it.</p>

<p>Doctor Norman Macleod tells how he was once
in a boat, on a Highland lake, when a storm came
on, which menaced him and his companions with
the most serious danger. The doctor, a tall,
strong man, had with him a Scotch minister, who
was small and delicate. The latter addressed himself
to the boatman, and, drawing his attention to
the danger they were in, proposed that they should
all pray.</p>

<p>"Na, na," said the boatman; "let the little ane
gang to pray, but first the big ane maun tak' an
oar, or we shall be drouned."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Donald is the most practical man on earth.</p>

<p>He is a man who takes life seriously, and whom
nothing will divert from the road that leads to the
goal.</p>

<p>He is a man who monopolises all the good
places in this world and the next; who keeps the
Commandments, and everything else worth keeping;
who swears by the Bible&mdash;and as hard<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> as
a Norman carter; who serves God every Sabbath
day and Mammon all the week; who has a talent
for keeping a great many things, it is true, but especially
his word, when he gives it you.</p>

<p>He is not a man of brilliant qualities, but he is
a man of solid ones, who can only be appreciated
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 11]</span>
at his true worth when you have known him some
time. He does not jump at you with demonstrations
of love, nor does he swear you an eternal
friendship; but if you know how to win his esteem,
you may rely upon him thoroughly.</p>

<p>He is a man who pays prompt cash, but will
have the value of his money.</p>

<p>If ever you travel with a Scotchman from Edinburgh
to London, you may observe that he does not
take his eyes off the country the train goes through.
He looks out of the window all the time, so as not
to miss a pennyworth of the money he has paid
for his place. Remark to him, as you yawn and
stretch yourself, that it's a long, tiring, tiresome
journey, and he will probably exclaim:</p>

<p>"Long, indeed, long! I should think so, sir;
and so it ought to be for &pound;2 17s. 6d.!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I know of a Scot, who, rather than pay the toll
of a bridge in Australia, takes off his coat, which
he rolls and straps on his back, in order to swim
across the stream.</p>

<p>He is not a miser; on the contrary, his generosity
is well known in his own neighbourhood.
He is simply an eccentric Scot, who does not see
why he should pay for crossing a river that he can
cross for nothing.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 12]</span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 68px;">
<img src="images/capa.jpg" width="68" height="80" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><p class="dropcap">ll the Scotch know how to read, write,
and reckon.</p>

<p>Especially reckon.</p>

<p>The following adventure happened but the
other day.</p>

<p>A wily Caledonian, accused of having insulted a
policeman, was condemned by the Bailie of his
village to pay a fine of half-a-crown, with the
alternative of six days' imprisonment.</p>

<p>As there are few Scots who have not half-a-crown
in their pockets, you will perhaps imagine
that Friend Donald paid the money, glad to get out
of the scrape so cheaply.</p>

<p>Not at all: when you are born in Scotland,
you do not part with your cash without a little
reflection.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>So Donald reflected a moment.</p>

<p>Will he pay or go to jail? His heart wavers.</p>

<p>"I will go to jail," he exclaims, suddenly struck
with a luminous idea.</p>

<p>Now the prison was in the chief town of his
county, and it so happened that he had a little
business to arrange there, but the railway fare was
two shillings and eight pence halfpenny.</p>

<p>He passes the night in the lock-up, and in the
morning is taken off by train to the prison.</p>

<p>Once safely there, Donald pulls half-a-crown
from his purse, and demands a receipt of the
governor, who has no choice but to give it him
and set him at liberty. Our hero, proud as a king
at the success of his plan, and the two pence halfpenny
clear profit it has brought him, steers for
the town and arranges his business.</p>

<p>Rabelais was not more cunning when he
hit upon his stratagem for getting carried to
Paris.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Scotch themselves are fond of telling the
following:</p>

<p>Dugald&mdash;"Did ye hear that Sandy McNab was
ta'en up for stealin' a coo?"</p>

<p>Donald&mdash;"Hoot, toot, the stipit body! Could
he no bocht it, and no paid for 't."</p>

<p>This explains why the Scotch prisons are relatively
empty. Donald is often in the county court,
but seldom in the police-court.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>A good Scot begins the day with the following
prayer:</p>

<p>"O Lord! grant that I may take no one in this
day, and that no one may take me in. If Thou
canst grant me but one of these favours, O Lord,
grant that no one may take me in."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He would be a clever fellow, however, who
could take in Donald.</p>

<p>There is no country where compacts are more
faithfully kept than in Scotland. When you have
the signature of a Scotchman in your pocket, you
may make your mind easy; but, if you sign an
agreement with him, you may be certain that he
runs no risk of repenting of the transaction.</p>

<p>He is rarely at fault in his reckoning; but if, by
chance, an error escapes him, it is not he who
suffers by it.</p>

<p>I must hasten, however, to say that the honesty
of the Scotch in England is proverbial. I have
always heard the English say they liked doing
business with Scotch firms, because they had the
very qualities desirable in a customer: straight-forwardness
and solvency.</p>

<p>Donald's honesty is all the more admirable,
because he is firmly convinced in his heart, that
he will go straight to Paradise whatever he may
do. You will confess that there is danger about a
Christian who feels sure that many things shall be
forgiven him.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps his honesty may be the result of reflection,
if the following little anecdote that was told
me in Scotland is any criterion:</p>

<p>A worthy father, feeling death at hand, sends
for his son to hear his last counsels.</p>

<p>"Donald," he says to him, "listen to the last
words of your old father. If you want to get on in
the world, be honest. Never forget that, in all
business, honesty is the best policy. You may
take my word for it, my son,&mdash;<i>I hae tried baith</i>."</p>

<p>This worthy Scot deserved an epitaph in the
style of that one which the late Count Beust
speaks of having seen on a tombstone at Highclere:</p>

<p>"Here lies Donald, who was as honest a man as
it is possible to be in this world."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Jews never got a footing in Scotland: they
would have starved there.</p>

<p>They came; but they saw ... and gave it up.</p>

<p>You may find one or two in Glasgow, but they
are in partnership with Scotchmen, and do not
form a band apart. They do not do much local
business: they are exporters and importers.</p>

<p>The Aberdonians tell of a Jew who once came
to their city and set up in business; but it was not
long before he packed up his traps and decamped
from that centre of Scotch 'cuteness.</p>

<p>"Why are you going?" they asked him. "Is it
because there are no Jews in Aberdeen?"<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, no," he replied; "I am going because
you are all Jews here."</p>

<p>An American was so ill-inspired as to try his
hand there where even a Jew had been beaten.</p>

<p>The good folk of Aberdeen are very proud of
telling the following anecdote, which dates from
only a few months back, and was in everyone's
mouth at the time of my visit to the city of
granite:</p>

<p>An American lecturer had signed an agreement
with an Aberdonian, by which he undertook to go
and lecture in Aberdeen for a fee of twenty pounds.</p>

<p>Dazzled by the success of his lectures, which
were drawing full houses in all parts of England,
the American bethought himself that he might have
made better terms with Donald. Acting on this
idea, he soon sent him a telegram, running thus:</p>

<p>"Enormous success. Invitations numerous.
Cannot do Aberdeen for less than thirty pounds.
Reply prepaid."</p>

<p>The Scot was not born to be taken in.</p>

<p>On the contrary.</p>

<p>Donald, armed with the treaty in his pocket,
goes calmly to the telegraph office and wires:</p>

<p>"All right. Come on."</p>

<p>Jonathan, encouraged by the success of this first
venture, rubs his hands, and, two days later, sends
a second telegram, as follows:</p>

<p>"Invitations more and more numerous. Impossible
to do Aberdeen for less than forty
pounds."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>Donald thinks the thing very natural, and laughs
in his sleeve. He bids the messenger wait, and
without hesitation he scribbles:</p>

<p>"All right. Come on."</p>

<p>Jonathan doubtless rubbed his hands harder
than ever, and might have been very surprised
if he had been told that Donald was rubbing
his too.</p>

<p>However, he arrived in Aberdeen radiant, gave
his lecture, and at the end was presented by
Donald with a cheque for twenty pounds.</p>

<p>"Twenty pounds&mdash;but it is forty pounds you
owe me!"</p>

<p>"You make a mistake," replied Donald, quietly:
"here is our treaty, signed and registered."</p>

<p>"But I sent you a telegram to tell you that
I could not possibly come for less than forty
pounds."</p>

<p>"Quite so," replied Donald, unmoved.</p>

<p>"And you answered&mdash;'All right. Come on.'"</p>

<p>"That is true."</p>

<p>"Well then?"</p>

<p>"Well, my dear sir, it is all right: you have
come&mdash;now, you may go."</p>

<p>Like the crow in La Fontaine's fable, Jonathan
registered a vow ... but a little late.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried the Aberdonian who told me the
story, "Jonathan will not go back to America to
tell his compatriots that he took in a Scotchman."
And his eyes gleamed with national pride as he
added: "It was no harm to try."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>He considered the conduct of the American
quite natural, it was clear.</p>

<p>As for me, I thought that "All right&mdash;come on,"
a magnificent example of Scotch diplomacy and
humour.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Donald has a still cooler head than his neighbour
John Bull, and that is saying a good deal.
In business, in love even, he never loses his head.
He is circumspect. He proceeds by insinuations,
still oftener by negations, and that even in the
most trifling matters. He does not commit himself:
he <i>doubts</i>, he goes as far as to <i>believe</i>; but he
will never push temerity so far as to be <i>perfectly
sure</i>. Ask a Scotchman how he is. He will
never reply that he is well, but that he is <i>no
bad ava</i>.</p>

<p>I heard a Scotchman tell the butler to fill his
guests' glasses in the following words:</p>

<p>"John, if you were to fill our glasses, we wadna
be the waur for 't."</p>

<p>Remark to a Highlander that the weather is
very warm, and he will reply:</p>

<p>"I don't doubt but it may be; but that's your
opinion."</p>

<p>This manner of expressing themselves in hints
and negations must have greatly sharpened the
wits of the Scotch.</p>

<p>Here, for instance, is a delicious way of making
a young girl understand that you love her, and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 19]</span>
wish to marry her. I borrow it from Dr. Ramsay's
<i>Reminiscences</i>.</p>

<p>Donald proposes to Mary a little walk.</p>

<p>They go out, and in their ramble they pass
through the churchyard.</p>

<p>Pointing with his finger to one of the graves,
this lover says:</p>

<p>"My folk lie there, Mary; wad ye like to lie
there?"</p>

<p>Mary took the grave hint, says the Doctor, and
became his wife, but does not yet <i>lie there</i>.</p>

<p>Much in the same vein is an anecdote that
was told me in an Edinburgh house one day at
dessert:</p>

<p>Jamie and Janet have long loved each other,
but neither has spoken word to the other of this
flame.</p>

<p>At last Donald one day makes up his mind to
break the ice.</p>

<p>"Janet," he says, "it must be verra sad to lie on
your death bed and hae no ane to houd your han'
in your last moments?"</p>

<p>"That is what I often say to mysel, Jamie. It
must be a pleasant thing to feel that a frien's
han' is there to close your ee when a' is ower."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, Janet; and that is what mak's me
sometimes think o' marriage. After all, we war
na made to live alone."</p>

<p>"For my pairt, I am no thinkin' o' matrimony.
But still, the thoucht of livin' wi' a mon that I
could care for is no disagreeable to me," says<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 20]</span>
Janet. "Unfortunately, I have not come across
him yet."</p>

<p>"I believe I hae met wi' the woman I loe," responds
Jamie; "but I dinna ken whether she lo'es
me."</p>

<p>"Why dinna ye ask her, Jamie?"</p>

<p>"Janet," says Jamie, without accompanying his
words with the slightest chalorous movement,
"wad ye be that woman I was speakin' of?"</p>

<p>"If I died before you, Jamie, I wad like your
han' to close my een."</p>

<p>The engagement was completed with a kiss to
seal the compact.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Scot, in his quality of a man of action,
talks little; all the less, perhaps, because he knows
that he will have to give an account of every idle
word in the Last Day.</p>

<p>He has reduced conversation to its simplest
expression. Sometimes even he will restrain himself,
much to the despair of foreigners, so far as to
only pronounce the accentuated syllable of each
word. What do I say? The syllable? He will
often sound but the vowel of that syllable.</p>

<p>Here is a specimen of Scotch conversation,
given by Dr. Ramsay:</p>

<p>A Scot, feeling the warp of a plaid hanging at a
tailor's door, enquires:</p>

<p>"Oo?" (Wool?)</p>

<p><i>Shopkeeper</i>&mdash;"Ay, oo." (Yes, wool.)<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p><i>Customer</i>&mdash;"A' oo?" (All wool?)</p>

<p><i>Shopkeeper</i>&mdash;"Ay, a' oo." (Yes, all wool.)</p>

<p><i>Customer</i>&mdash;"A' ae oo?" (All one wool?)</p>

<p><i>Shopkeeper</i>&mdash;"Ay, a' ae oo." (Yes, all one wool.)</p>

<p>These are two who will not have much to fear
on the Day of Judgment&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>You may, perhaps, imagine that laconism could
no further go.</p>

<p>But you are mistaken; I have something better
still to give you.</p>

<p>Alfred Tennyson at one time often paid a visit
to Thomas Carlyle at Chelsea.</p>

<p>On one of those occasions, these two great men,
having gone to Carlyle's library to have a quiet
chat together, seated themselves one on each side
of the fireplace, and lit their pipes.</p>

<p>And there for two hours they sat, plunged in
profound meditation, the silence being unbroken
save for the little dry regular sound that the lips
of the smokers made as they sent puffs of smoke
soaring to the ceiling. Not one single word broke
the silence.</p>

<p>After two hours of this strange converse between
two great souls that understood each other without
speech, Tennyson rose to take leave of his
host. Carlyle went with him to the door, and
then, grasping his hand, uttered these words:</p>

<p>"Eh, Alfred, we've had a grand nicht! Come
back again soon."</p>

<p>If Thomas Carlyle had lived at Hamadan, he
would have been worthy to fill the first seat in the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 22]</span>
Silent Academy, the chief statute of which was, as
you may remember, worded thus:</p>

<p>"The Academicians must think much, write
little, and speak as seldom as possible."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Another Scot very worthy of a place in the
Silent Academy was the late Christopher North.</p>

<p>A professor of the Edinburgh University, having
asked him for the hand of his daughter Jane,
Christopher North fixed a small ticket to Miss
Jane's chest, and announced his decision by thus
presenting the young lady to the professor, who
read with glad eyes:</p>

<p>"With the Author's compliments."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/cape.jpg" width="50" height="80" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><p class="dropcap">ver since the French first heard Bo&iuml;eldieu's
opera, <i>La Dame Blanche</i>, and were charmed
with the chorus, "Chez les montagnards
&eacute;cossais l'hospitalit&eacute; se donne," the Highlander<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 23]</span>
has enjoyed a tremendous reputation for hospitality
on the other side of the Channel.</p>

<p>I am ready to acknowledge that the Scotch, as
a nation, are most hospitable; but do not talk to
me of the hospitality of the Highlander.</p>

<p>The hospitality of the mountains, like that of
the valleys, is extinct in almost every place where
modern civilisation has penetrated; the real old-fashioned
article is scarcely to be found except
among the savages.</p>

<p>Donald has made the acquaintance of railways
and mail coaches, he has transformed his Highlands
into a kind of little Switzerland; in fact,
the man is no longer recognisable.</p>

<p>The Highlander of the year of grace 1887 is a
wideawake dog, who lies in wait for the innocent
tourist, and knows how to tot you up a bill worthy
of a Parisian boarding-house keeper at Exhibition
time. Woe to you if you fall into his clutches;
before you come out of them you will be plucked,
veritably flayed.</p>

<p>The Highlander worships two trinities: the
holy one on Sundays, and a metallic one all the
week. &pound;. s. d. is the base of his language. Though
Gaelic should be the veriest Hebrew to you, you
have but to learn the meaning and pronunciation
of the three magic words, and you will have no
difficulty in getting along in the Highlands.</p>

<p>Every Sabbath he goes in for a thorough spiritual
cleaning; therefore trust him not on Saturday
or Monday&mdash;on Saturday, because he says to him<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 24]</span>self,
"Oh! one transgression more or less whilst
I am at it, what does it matter? it is Sunday
to-morrow;" on Monday, because he is all fresh
washed, and ready to begin the week worthily.</p>

<p>He has a way of giving you your change which
seems to say, "Is it the full change you expect?"
If you keep your hand held out, and appear to
examine what he gives you, his look says: "You
are one of the wideawake sort; we understand
each other."</p>

<p>Needless to say that the Highlander is glad
to see the tourist, as the hunter is glad to see
game.</p>

<p>Frenchmen, Germans, Russians, Englishmen,
Americans, all are sure of a welcome&mdash;he loves
them all alike.</p>

<p>Still, perhaps of all the foreign tourists who
visit his hunting-grounds, it is the Americans who
have found the royal road to his heart.</p>

<p>"The Americans are a great people," said a
Highland innkeeper to me one day. "When you
present an Englishman with his bill, he looks it
over to see that it is all right. He will often dispute
and haggle. The American is a gentleman;
he would think it beneath him to descend to such
trifles. When you bring him his account, he will
wave your hand away and tell you he does not
want your bill; he wants to know how much he
owes you, and that's the end of it."</p>

<p>His idea of a perfect gentleman is an innocent
who pays his bills without looking at them.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>When he recognises a tourist as a compatriot,
you may imagine what a wry face he makes.</p>

<p>Just as the hotel-keeper of Interlaken or Chamounix
relegates all his Swiss customers to the
fifth floor rooms, so Donald gives the cold shoulder
to all the Scotch who come his way. With them
he is obliged to submit his bills to the elementary
rules of arithmetic, and be careful that two and
two make only four.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It is said that of all the inhabitants of the earth,
the Paris <i>badaud</i> is the most easy to amuse. I
think, for my part, that his London equivalent
runs him very close. However this may be, the
native of London is an easy prey to the wily Scot.</p>

<p>They are fond of telling, in Scotland, how
friend Donald one day showed a Cockney really
prodigious things in the Isle of Arran.</p>

<p>A Londoner, wishing to astonish his friends
with the account of his adventures in Scotland,
resolved to make the ascent of the Goatfell
without the aid of a guide. Arrived at the foot
of the mountain, he informed the guides, who
came to offer him their services, of his intention.
You may imagine if Donald, who had sniffed a
good day's work, meant to give up his bread and
butter without a struggle.</p>

<p>"Your project is a mad one," our tourist is told.
"You will miss many splendid points of view, and
you will run a thousand risks."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>The ascension of the Goatfell is about as difficult
as that of the Monument; but our hero, who
knew nothing about it, began to turn pale.</p>

<p>However, he appeared determined to keep to
his resolution; and Donald, who considers he is
being robbed every time anyone climbs his hills
without a guide, begins to grumble.</p>

<p>Besides, when one is a Highlander, one does
not give up a point so easily as all that. Our
Caledonian resorts to diplomacy. A brilliant idea
occurs to him.</p>

<p>"Since you will not have a guide," says he,
pretending to withdraw, "good luck to you on
your journey! Mind you don't miss the mysterious
stone."</p>

<p>"What mysterious stone?" demands the
Cockney.</p>

<p>"Oh, on the top of the Goatfell," replies
Donald, "there is a stone that might well be
called <i>enchanted</i>. When you stand upon that
stone, no sound, no matter how close or how
loud, can reach your ears."</p>

<p>"Really?" says the tourist, gaping.</p>

<p>"A thunderstorm might burst just above your
head, and you would never hear it," added Donald,
who saw that his bait was beginning to take.</p>

<p>"Prodigious!" cried the Londoner. "How
shall I know the stone? Do tell me."</p>

<p>"Not easily," insinuated Donald slyly; "it is
scarcely known except to guides. However, I
will try to describe its position to you."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>Here the Scot entered into explanations which
threw the Cockney's brain into a complete muddle.</p>

<p>"I had better take you, after all, I think," said
the bewildered tourist. "Come along."</p>

<p>I need not tell you that they were soon at the
wonderful stone.</p>

<p>The Londoner took up his position on it, and
begged the guide to stand a few steps off and to
shout at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>Out Scot fell to making all sorts of contortions,
placing his hands to his mouth as if to carry the
sound; but not a murmur reached the ears of the
tourist.</p>

<p>"Take a rest," he said to Donald; "you will
make yourself hoarse.... It is a fact that I
have not heard a sound. It is prodigious! Now
you go and stand on the stone, and I will shout."</p>

<p>They changed places.</p>

<p>The Cockney began to rave with all his might.</p>

<p>Donald did not move a muscle.</p>

<p>The dear Londoner made the hills ring with
the sound of his voice, but his guide gazed at him
as calmly as Nature that surrounded them.</p>

<p>"Don't you hear anything?" cried the poor
tourist.</p>

<p>Donald was not so silly as to fall into the trap.
He feigned not to hear, and kept up his impassive
expression.</p>

<p>The Cockney continued to howl.</p>

<p>"Shout louder," cried Donald; "I can hear
nothing."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>"It's wonderful; it is enough to take one's
breath away. I never saw anything so remarkable
in my life!"</p>

<p>And putting his hand in his pocket, he drew
out a golden coin, and slipped it into Donald's
hand.</p>

<p>This done, they left the marvel behind, and
climbed to the summit of the Goatfell, the clever
guide carefully picking out all the roughest paths,
and doing his best to give his patient plenty of
dangers for his money.</p>

<p>That night, after having made a note of all his
day's adventures, the proud tourist added, as a
future caution to his friends:</p>

<p>"Be sure and take a guide for the Goatfell!"</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">riend Donald resembles the Norman
very closely.</p>

<p>Like him, he is cunning and circumspect,
with the composed exterior of Puss taking
a doze.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>We say in France, "Answering like a Norman."
That means, "to give an evasive, ambiguous
answer&mdash;neither <i>yes</i> nor <i>no</i>."</p>

<p>They might say in England, "Answering like a
Scot," to express the same idea.</p>

<p>Look at Donald, with the corners of his mouth
drawn back, and his eyes twinkling as he nods at
you and answers <i>Ay</i>, or shakes his head as he says
<i>Na</i>, <i>na</i>; and you will be convinced that he is compromised
neither by the one nor the other.</p>

<p>At market the resemblance is perfect.</p>

<p>He strolls into the stall as if he did not want
anything more than a look round. He examines
the goods with a most indifferent eye, turns them
over and over, and finds fault with them. He
seems to say to the stall-keeper:</p>

<p>"You certainly could not have the impudence
to ask a good price for such stuff as this."</p>

<p>If he buys, he pays with a protest.</p>

<p>When he pockets cash, on the contrary, admire
the rapidity of the proceeding.</p>

<p>I one day heard a Norman, who had just been
profiting by being in town on market-day to get
shaved, say to the barber, with the most innocent
air in the world:</p>

<p>"My word, I'm very sorry not to have a penny
to give you, but my wife and I have spent all our
money; I have only a halfpenny left.... I will
owe you till next time."</p>

<p>Compare this Norman with the hero of the
following little anecdote which the Scotch tell.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>A Scot, who sold brooms, went into a Glasgow
barber's shop to get shaved.</p>

<p>The barber bought a broom of Donald, and,
after having shaved him, asked what he owed him
for the broom.</p>

<p>"Two pence," said Donald.</p>

<p>"No, no," said the barber; "it's too dear. I will
give you a penny, and if you are not satisfied, you
can take your broom again."</p>

<p>Donald pocketed the penny, and asked what he
had to pay for being shaved.</p>

<p>"A penny," replied the barber.</p>

<p>"Na, na," said Donald; "I will give ye a
bawbee, an' if ye are no satisfied, ye can pit my
beard back again."</p>

<p>This is Norman to the life.</p>

<p>The Scot pays when he has given his signature,
or when there is no help for it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It has been said that the farthing was introduced
to allow the Scotch to be generous. This
is calumny; for the Scot is charitable: but if
collections in Scotch churches were made in bags,
there might be rather a run on the small copper
coin.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>If you would see still another point of resemblance
between the Scot and the Norman,
look at them as they indulge in their little pet
transgression.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>When Donald orders his glass of whisky, he is
always careful to say:</p>

<p>"Waiter, a <i>small</i> whisky."</p>

<p>The Irishman asks for a "strong whisky,"
straight out, like a man.</p>

<p>Donald is modest, he asks for his <i>small</i>. That
is the allowance of sober folks, and the dear fellow
is one of them. But just add up at the end of the
evening the number of <i>wee draps</i> that he has on
his conscience, and you will find they make a very
respectable total.</p>

<p>Now look at the Norman taking his cups of <i>caf&eacute;
tricolore</i> after dinner.</p>

<p>Do not imagine that he is going to take up the
three bottles of brandy, rum, and kirschwasser,
and pour himself out some of their contents.
No, no; he would be too much afraid of exceeding
the dose. He measures it into his spoon, which
he holds horizontally; and, to see the precautions
he takes, you would think he was a chemist preparing
a doctor's prescription.</p>

<p>"A teaspoonful of each," he says to you; "that
is my quantity."</p>

<p>But how they brim over, those spoonfuls!
When the overflow has fallen into the cup, he
shows you the full spoon, with the remark:</p>

<p>"One of each kind, no more."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Scotch shrewdness expresses itself in a phraseology
all its own, and of which Donald alone<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 32]</span>
possesses the secret. He handles the English
language with the talent of the most wily
diplomatist. He has a happy knack of combining
irony and humour, as the following story shows:</p>

<p>An English author had sent his latest production
to several men of letters, requesting them to kindly
give him their opinion of his book. A Scotchman
replied:</p>

<p>"Many thanks for the book which you did me
the honour to send me. I will lose no time in
reading it."</p>

<p>Quite a Norman response, only more delicate.</p>

<p>Scotch shrewdness has occasionally a certain
smack of mild hypocrisy, which, however, does
no harm to anyone.</p>

<p>Here are two examples of it that rather
diverted me:</p>

<p>I was in the smoking-room of the Grand Hotel
at Glasgow one evening.</p>

<p>Near me, sitting at a little table, were two
gentlemen&mdash;unmistakably Scotch, as their accent
proclaimed.</p>

<p>One of them calls the waiter, and orders a glass
of whisky.</p>

<p>"What is the number of your room, sir?" asks
the waiter, having put the whisky and water-jug
on the table.</p>

<p>"No matter, waiter; don't put it on the bill.
Here is the money."</p>

<p>"Very clever, that Caledonian," said I to
myself, as I noted the wink to the waiter and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 33]</span>
the glance thrown to the other occupant of the
table.</p>

<p>True it is, <i>Scripta manent</i>!</p>

<p>If his wife accidentally puts her hand on his
hotel bill in the pocket of his coat, there is no
harm done&mdash;no sign of any but the most innocent
articles.</p>

<p>Another time I was in a Scotchman's library.</p>

<p>While waiting for my host, who was to rejoin
me there, I had a look at his books, most of which
treated of theology.</p>

<p>Two volumes, admirably bound, attracted my
gaze. They were marked on the back&mdash;one, <i>Old
Testament</i>, the other, <i>New Testament</i>. I tried to take
down the first volume; but, to my surprise, the
second moved with it. Were the two volumes
fixed together? or were they stuck by accident?
Not suspecting any mystery, I pulled hard. The
Old Testament and the New Testament were in
one, and came together. The handsome binding
was nothing but the cover of a box of cigars.
No more Testament than there is on the palm
of my hand: cigars&mdash;first-rate cigars&mdash;nothing
but cigars, placed there under the protection of the
holy patriarchs.</p>

<p>I had time to put all in place again before my
host came; but I was not at my ease. I was quite
innocent, of course; but&mdash;I don't know why&mdash;when
one has discovered a secret, one feels
guilty of having taken something that belongs to
another.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>At last my host entered, closed the door, and,
rubbing his hands, said:</p>

<p>"Now I am at your service. Excuse me for
leaving you alone a few moments. I have settled
my business, and we will have a cigar together, if
you like."</p>

<p>So saying, he opened the door of a small cupboard
made in the wall, and cleverly hidden by a
picture of "John Knox imploring Mary Stuart to
abjure the Catholic faith." It was, as you see,
rather a mysterious library. From this cupboard
he took some glasses&mdash;and something to fill
them agreeably withal. Then, without betraying
the slightest embarrassment, without a smile
or a glance, he brought the twin volumes which
had so astonished me, and laid them on the
table. I had the pleasure of making closer
acquaintance with the cigars, that seemed to
bring a recommendation from Moses and the
prophets.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>An anecdote on the ready wit of Donald:</p>

<p>He meets his pastor, who remonstrates with
him upon the subject of his intemperate habits.</p>

<p>"You are too fond of whisky, Donald; you
ought to know very well that whisky is your
enemy."</p>

<p>"But, minister, have you not often told us that
we ought to love our enemies?" says Donald,
slyly.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, Donald; but I never told you that you
should swallow them," replies the pastor, who was
as witty as his parishioner.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>What anecdotes I heard in Scotland on the
subject of whisky, to be sure!</p>

<p>Here is a good one for the last. I owe it to a
learned professor of the Aberdeen University.</p>

<p>Donald feels the approach of death.</p>

<p>The minister of his village is at his bedside,
preparing him by pious exhortations for the great
journey.</p>

<p>"Have you anything on your mind, Donald?
Is there any question you would like to ask me?"
And the minister bent down to listen to the dying
man's reply.</p>

<p>"Na, meenister, I'm na afeard.... I
wad like to ken whether there'll be whisky in
heaven?"</p>

<p>Upon his spiritual counsellor remonstrating with
him upon such a thought at such a moment, he
hastened to add, with a knowing look:</p>

<p>"Oh! it's no that I mind, meenister; I only
thoucht I'd like to see it on the table!"<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 36]</span></p>

</div><p class="dropcap">he Scotch are an essentially democratic
people. I take the word in its social, not
its political, sense; although it might be
asserted without hesitation, that if ever there was
a nation formed for living under a republic, it is
the Scotch&mdash;serious, calm, wise, law-abiding, and
ever ready to respect the opinions of others. Yet
the Scotch are perhaps the most devoted subjects
of the English crown.</p>

<p>The English and Scotch are republicans, with
democratic institutions, living under a monarchy.</p>

<p>When I say that the Scotch are a democratic
people, I mean that in Scotland, still more than in
England, one man is as good as another.</p>

<p>The Scot does not admit the existence of demigods.
In his eyes, the robes of the priest or judge
cover a man, not an oracle.</p>

<p>Always ready for a bit of argument, he criticises
an order, a sermon, a verdict even.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>Religious as he is, yet he will weigh every
utterance of his pastor before accepting it. He
respects the law; but if his bailie inflicts on him a
fine that he thinks unjust, he does not scruple to
tell him a piece of his mind; and if ever you wish
to be told your daily duty at home, you have but
to engage a Scotch servant.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Donald knows how to accept social inferiority;
he may perhaps envy his betters, but he does not
hate them. He never abdicates his manhood's
dignity: an obsequious Scotchman is unknown.</p>

<p>In Scotland, even a beggar has none of those
abject manners that denote his class elsewhere.
His look seems to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, my fine fellow, listen to me a minute:
you have money and I have none; you might give
me a penny."</p>

<p>I remember one in Edinburgh, who stopped
me politely, yet without touching his cap, and
said:</p>

<p>"You look as if you had had a good dinner,
sir; won't you give me something to buy a meal
with?"</p>

<p>I took him to a cook-shop and bought him a
pork pie.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind," said he, "I'll have veal."</p>

<p>Why certainly! everyone to his taste, to be sure.</p>

<p>I acquiesced with alacrity. He was near shaking
hands with me.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>Donald is plain spoken with everyone. In
Scotland, as in France, there are still to be found
old servants whose familiarity would horrify an
Englishman, but whom the <i>bonhomie</i> of Scotch
masters tolerates without a murmur, in consideration
of the fidelity and devotion of these honest
servants.</p>

<p>Like every man who is conscious of his strength,
the Scot is good-humoured; he rarely loses his
temper.</p>

<p>The familiarity of the servant and good-humour
of the master, in Scotland, are delightfully illustrated
in the two following anecdotes, which were
told me in Scotland.</p>

<p>Donald is serving at table. Several guests
claim his attention at once: one wants bread,
another wine, another vegetables. Donald does
not know which way to turn. Presently, losing
patience, he apostrophises the company thus:</p>

<p>"That's it; cry a'together&mdash;that's the way to be
served!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A laird, in the county of Aberdeen, had a well-stocked
fowl yard, but could never get any new-laid
eggs for breakfast.</p>

<p>He wanted to penetrate the mystery. So he
lay in ambush, and discovered that his gardener's
wife went to the hen-roost every morning, filled
her basket with the eggs, and made straight for
the market to sell them.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>The first time he met his gardener, he said to
him:</p>

<p>"James, I like you very weel, for I think you
serve me faithfully; but, between oursels, I canna
say that I hae muckle admiration for your wife."</p>

<p>"I'm no surprised at that, laird," replied James,
"for I dinna muckle admire her mysel!"</p>

<p>What could the poor laird say? This fresh
union of sympathies united them only more closely.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Proud as a Highlander" is a common saying.
His gait tells you what he is. He walks with
head thrown back, and shoulders squared; his
step is firm and springy. It is a man who says to
himself twenty times a day:</p>

<p>"I am a Scotchman."</p>

<p>Such an exalted opinion has he of his race that
when Queen Victoria gave Princess Louise to the
Marquis of Lorne in marriage, the general feeling
in the Highlands was, as everybody knows, "The
Queen maun be a prood leddy the day!"</p>

<p>The English were astonished at the Queen's
consenting to give her daughter to one of her
subjects. They looked upon it as a <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>.
The Scotch were not far from doing the same&mdash;a
Campbell marry a simple Brunswick!</p>

<p>It is in the Highlands that this national pride is
preserved intact. Mountainous countries always
keep their characteristics longer than others.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that the Queen of England<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 40]</span>
passes a great part of the year in her Castle of
Balmoral, in the heart of the Highlands, among
her worthy Scotch people, whom she appears to
prefer to all her other subjects. She visits the
humblest cottages, and sends delicacies to the
sick and aged.</p>

<p>The good folk do not accept the bounty of their
Queen without making her a return for it in
kind. Yes&mdash;in kind. The women knit her a pair
of stockings or a shawl, and the Queen delights
them by accepting their presents.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">t is not in business alone that the Scotchman
shows that obstinate perseverance which so
characterises his nation. Thomas Carlyle
would have passed a whole year searching out the
exact date of the most insignificant incident.
That is why his <i>Frederick the Great</i> is the finest
historical monument of the century.</p>

<p>It is this same Scotch perseverance which makes
Watts, Livingstones, and Gordons. Never were<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 41]</span>
there brighter illustrations of what can be done
by power of mind united to power of endurance.</p>

<p>I have seen them at work, those resolute, indomitable
Scots. I have known some whose
performances were nothing short of feats of valour.</p>

<p>Here is one that I have fresh in my memory.</p>

<p>A young Scotchman, on leaving Oxford, had
been appointed master in one of the great public
schools of England. He began with the elementary
classes. At that time he intended to devote
himself to the study of science.</p>

<p>He told the head master of his intention, and
asked his advice.</p>

<p>"If I were you," said the head master, "I would
do nothing of the kind. I feel sure you have very
special aptitude for Greek, and that if you will
but direct your attention to that, you have a
brilliant future before you. Let me trace you out
a programme?"</p>

<p>This programme was enough to frighten the
most enterprising of men. A Scotchman alone
could undertake to carry it out.</p>

<p>Our young master accepted the task.</p>

<p>He took an apartment in the Temple, turned
his back on his friends, and became an inaccessible
hermit.</p>

<p>For three years he lived only for his books,
consecrating to them that which, at his age, is
generally consecrated to pleasure and comfort.</p>

<p>Nothing could turn him from the end he had in
view.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>One after another he read all the Greek authors.
Nothing that had been written by poet, philosopher,
historian, or grammarian, escaped him.</p>

<p>At the end of three years, he reappeared, wasted
by the vigils and privations of this life of study;
but the last touches had been put to the manuscript
of a book, which, when it appeared three
months later, was pronounced a masterpiece of
scholarship, and made quite a revolution in the
Greek world.</p>

<p>To-day this young Scotchman is one of the
brightest lights in the higher walks of literature
in Great Britain.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The students of the great Universities of Scotland
offer, perhaps, the most striking proofs of
perseverance to be found.</p>

<p>At Oxford and Cambridge, you find all sorts of
students, especially students who do not study.</p>

<p>In Scotland, all students study.</p>

<p>To be able to have the luxury of studying, or
rather "residing" (such is the less pretentious
name in use), at Oxford or Cambridge, you must
be well-to-do.</p>

<p>In Scotland, as in Germany, Greece, Switzerland,
and America, the poorest young men may
aspire to university honours; but often at the cost
of what privations!</p>

<p>Here are a few incidents of students' life in
Scotland. They struck me as being very interest<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 43]</span>ing,
very touching. I borrow them, for the most
part, from a writer who published them in a Scotch
<i>Review</i> during my stay in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>He mentions one young man, of fine manners
and aristocratic appearance, who dined but three
times a week, and then upon a hot two-penny pie.
On the other days he lived on dry bread.</p>

<p>Another had an ingenious way of turning his
scanty resources to account. Spreading out his
books where the hearthrug would naturally have
been, he would lie there, learning his task by the
light of a fire, made from the roots of decayed
trees, which he had dug in a wood near Edinburgh,
and carried to his lodgings.</p>

<p>Three Scotchmen, now occupying high positions,
shared a room containing one bed; and for a year
at least, while attending Aberdeen University,
they had no other lodging. The bed was a very
narrow one, and quite incapable of holding two
persons at once; so two worked while the other
slept, and when they went to bed, he rose.</p>

<p>Two other students excited a great deal of
curiosity for some time. One carried his books
before him just as if they had been a tray, while
he glided noiselessly to his place. This mystery
was explained when it was learned that he had
been a hotel waiter. During the winter he pursued
his studies; and when summer returned, it
found him, with serviette across his arm, earning
the necessary fees for his next winter's course of
study.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>He never could quite throw off the waiter.
If a professor called his name suddenly, he
would start up and answer, "Coming, sir&mdash;coming!"</p>

<p>The other was more mysterious still. As soon
as recitation was over, he would start away from
the class-room and make for the environs of the
town as fast as he could run. It was at last discovered
that he kept a little book shop at some
distance from the University, and, being too poor
to hire an assistant, had to close his door to customers
while he went to recite his lessons.</p>

<p>Professor Blackie tells of one young student,
who lived for a whole session on red herrings and
a barrel of potatoes, sent him from home. The
poor fellow's health so gave way under this meagre
diet, that he died before his course of study was
finished.</p>

<p>The learned Professor mentions also another
very touching case of a young student who fell a
victim to his thirst for knowledge. The poor
fellow had so weakened his stomach by privation,
that he died from eating a good meal given him by
a kind friend.</p>

<p>I said just now that little work was done
at the University of Oxford. Exception must,
however, be made in the case of the famous
Balliol College.</p>

<p>But whom do we find there?</p>

<p>This college is full of Scotch students, who
succeed in keeping themselves at Oxford, thanks<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 45]</span>
to their frugality and industry. It is not unfrequent
to find them giving lessons to the undergraduates
of other colleges!</p>

<p>And what lessons the Scotch can give the
English!</p>

one after the other. A bright idea occurred to

of his host.</p>

the Bible, which every true Scot is full of, comes
up as the whisky goes down; so that when the
said whisky has floated the Bible, the Scotchman
begins to discuss the most subtle biblical
questions.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This is how the evening is passed in Scotland.</p>

<p>Dinner is served about seven. After dessert,
the ladies retire to the drawing-room while the
gentlemen finish their wine, smoke, and take
coffee. This done, they join the ladies in the
drawing-room, where tea is served, and an hour
or so passed in conversation and music. At
eleven, the gentlemen return to the dining-room
or go to the library. Whisky and cigars are
brought, and the f&ecirc;te begins. Several times,
when the master of the house beckoned to me to
follow him from the drawing-room, I tried to make
him understand that I was very contented in the
company of the ladies; but it was useless. He
would generally take my arm and say:</p>

<p>"Come along!"</p>

<p>As who should say:</p>

<p>"Enough of that; you are a man, are you not?
Come and pass the evening in manly fashion."</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but follow.</p>

<p>I pleaded all kinds of excuses to avoid this part
of the entertainment.</p>

<p>"The doctor has forbidden me to drink," I<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 48]</span>
mildly suggested once or twice, "or I should be
very happy, I assure you."</p>

<p>Occasionally I tried to bring to bear more serious
reasons&mdash;business reasons&mdash;such as:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, I have to lecture almost every
day, and I am a little afraid for my voice."</p>

<p>Much use this! Such an excuse came near
rendering me ridiculous in the eyes of those lusty
Scots. They were ready to exclaim,</p>

<p>"What milksops those Frenchmen are!"</p>

<p>For the honour of the French flag, I would mix
myself a glass of toddy; and by just taking a sip
every quarter of an hour, make it last out the
sitting, which seldom ended before two in the
morning.</p>

<p>By a little after midnight, the tongues seem to
tire, and conversation flags. At regular intervals
come the solemn puff, puff, puff, from the smokers'
lips, and the long spiral columns of smoke float
noiselessly upwards. The faces grow long and
solemn to match: it is the Bible rising to the
surface. Soon it floats&mdash;as I explained just now&mdash;and
conversation starts again on theology.
Each has his own manner of interpreting the
Scriptures, and burns to explain it to his neighbour.
Then follow the subtlest arguments, the
most interminable discussions. I listen. If I
have not many talents, I have at least one&mdash;that
of being able to hold my tongue in English,
Scotch, and all imaginable languages.</p>

<p>The whisky continues to pass from the bottle to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 49]</span>
the glasses, and from the glasses to the throats of
the company. The Bible comes up faster than
ever. When the guests are well emptied of
theology, everyone takes his nightcap&mdash;the signal
for breaking up. The nightcap is generally the
little whisky left in the decanter; to do it honour,
it is taken neat. All get up, shake hands, and say
Good-night. As you leave your host, you ask
him at what time breakfast is served, and he
replies:</p>

<p>"At eight."</p>

<p>At eight! Can he mean it? Deducting the
necessary time for undressing, and for getting
through your morning toilet, there remain scarcely
five hours for sleep. The thought that you must
make haste and get to sleep, in order to have a
chance of being able to wake between seven and
half-past, is just enough to prevent you from
closing your eyes for the night. Thank goodness,
your host, in his solicitude, has foreseen the
difficulty. At seven o'clock, a horrible din makes
you start up in bed and tremble from head to foot.
It is a servant sounding the gong&mdash;a sort of tam-tam
of Chinese invention&mdash;which fills the house
with a noise fit to make you reproduce all the contortions
that manufacturers of porcelain attribute
to the Celestials. You rise, and dress as fast as
you can. Your features look drawn; your head
feels upside down; your eyes seem coming out of
your head; you have the hairache: but you
console yourself with the thought of the others.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 50]</span>
What will they be like? What a figure they will
cut at table!</p>

<p>You were never more mistaken. In they come,
the lusty rascals, looking as bright as the lark.
Nothing on their faces betray the libations of over
night, or the scanty measure of sleep they have
been able to get.</p>

<p>"What an iron race, these Scots!" I have
often exclaimed to myself. "Who could hope to
compete with them?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 60px;">
<img src="images/capg.jpg" width="60" height="80" alt="G" title="G" />
</div><p class="dropcap">reat Britain boasts two State
Churches: the Anglican, or Episcopal,
Church in England and Wales, and the
Presbyterian Church in Scotland.</p>

<p>The Presbyterian Church is not under the jurisdiction
of a bishop, but of a General Assembly,
composed of lay and ecclesiastical deputies
elected by the towns and universities, and pre<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 51]</span>sided
over by a Moderator, elected by the Assembly,
and a Lord High Commissioner, appointed
every year by the Queen, and requited for this
arduous task with two thousand pounds.</p>

<p>The Scotch Presbyterian Church was established
in 1560; but the Stuarts re-established the
Episcopalian Church in 1662. The Revolution of
1688, followed by the accession of the Prince of
Orange to the throne of England, made Presbyterianism
flourish again, and its ministers still
receive emoluments from the State.</p>

<p>The Episcopalian Church still exists in Scotland,
governed by seven bishops; but, by the
irony of fate, she has become, as it were, a sort
of dissenting Church.</p>

<p>Scotland has many Catholics. Two archbishops
and four bishops watch over the spiritual
health of this flock.</p>

<p>In 1843, many Scotchmen, having discovered
that it was contrary to Scripture to have ministers
appointed by the State, founded the Free
Church, which at the present time rivals the
Presbyterian in importance.</p>

<p>The religious zeal of the Scotch may be judged
from the fact that, in the year of the separation,
a sum of nearly &pound;400,000 was contributed by the
faithful desirous of founding a Free Church. This
Church has eleven hundred pastors, receiving
salaries of about &pound;200 a year. Not less than
&pound;560,000 were sent, in 1882, to the Chief Moderator,
to help meet the expenses of this free faith.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>Such are the large centres of religious activity.
Besides these, there are, as in England, nearly
two hundred dissenting sects.</p>

<p>You may imagine whether the Devil has a hard
time of it in Scotland.</p>

<p>All these spiritual insurance companies live in
perfect harmony, and are flourishing.</p>

<p>It is only the Scotch bishops who cut a rather
pitiable figure. To be a lord bishop, and not to
be able to lord it a little, is hard. When I was in
the North of Scotland, I saw one arrive at Buckie
station, on his way to inspect the church of the
town. The clergyman had come to meet him.
They took the road to the vicarage, <i>pedibus cum
jambis</i>, and my lord bishop's gaiters attracted no
more attention from the good Buckie folk than
did the ulster of your humble servant.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In Catholic countries, where religion exacts a
life of sacrifice and abnegation from its ministers,
the priesthood is a vocation. In Protestant countries,
where religion imposes but few restrictions
on those who serve about the altar, the Church is
a profession.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Scotch places of worship are much alike inside
and out. Outside, the roofs are more or less
pointed; inside, the singing is more or less out
of tune.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>Let us go into the first we come to.</p>

<p>Four whitewashed walls, with a ceiling to match,
or a roof supported by bare rafters; no pictures,
no statues; just straight-backed benches, and a
high desk or pulpit: it is a lecture-room. Not
a single outer sign of fervour: no kneeling, no
clasped hands, or other sign of supplication.
The faces are cross-looking and forbidding, or
else apathetic.</p>

<p>It is curious to reflect that these unmoved faces
belong to people who would die to defend their
liberty of conscience.</p>

<p>Drawling hymns, psalms and canticles sung in
the twelve different semi-tones of the chromatic
scale; sermons full of theological subtleties, objections
raised and explained away.</p>

<p>The preacher does not seek to appeal to the
soul by eloquence, to the heart by tenderness and
grace, or to the taste by style. He addresses
himself to the reason alone.</p>

<p>Some preachers read their sermons, some recite
them, others give them <i>ex tempore</i>. These latter
are the most interesting.</p>

<p>Here and there I heard sermons that were
enough to send one to sleep on one's feet; you
can imagine the effect upon an audience who had
to hear them in a sitting posture. But Scotland
has not the monopoly of this kind of eloquence;
from time immemorial it has been the custom of a
certain proportion of church-goers to shut their
eyes to listen to the sermon.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>Religion is still sterner in Scotland than in
England. It is arid, like the soil of the country;
angular, like the bodies of the inhabitants; thorny,
like the national emblem of Scotland.</p>

<p>One Sunday I went to a church in Glasgow.
The preacher chose for his text the passage from
St. Matthew's Gospel commencing with "No
man can serve two masters," and ending "Ye
cannot serve God and Mammon."</p>

<p>About three thousand worshippers, careworn
and devoured by the thirst for lucre, listened
unmoved to the diatribes of the worthy pastor,
and were preparing, by a day of rest, for the
headlong race after wealth that they were going
to resume on the morrow.</p>

<p>What a never-ending theme is the contempt
for riches! What sermons in the desert,
preached by bishops with princely pay, or
poor curates who treat fortune as Master
Reynard treated certain grapes that hung out
of reach.</p>

<p>I was never more edified than on that Sunday
in Glasgow, especially when the assembly struck
up&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"O Paradise, O Paradise!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis weary waiting here;</span><br />
I long to be where Jesus is,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To feel, to see him near.</span><br />
O Paradise, O Paradise!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I greatly long to see</span><br />
The special place my dearest Lord<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In love prepares for me!"</span><br />
</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 55]</span>"Ah!
my dear Caledonians," thought I, seeing
them in such a hurry, "it is better to suffer, even
in Glasgow, than to die!"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>Mieux vaut souffrir que mourir<br />
C'est la devise des hommes.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>By the bye, dear reader, how do you like the
expression <i>special place</i>? Did I exaggerate when
I told you the Scotch expect to find places specially
reserved for them in Heaven?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This is how I learned by experience never to
enter into theological discussions with the Scotch.</p>

<p>I had been to morning service in an Edinburgh
church with a Scotchman, and there again had
heard a sermon on the worthlessness of riches.
The minister had preached from the text, "And
again I say unto you: it is easier for a camel to
go through the eye of a needle than for a rich
man to enter into the kingdom of Heaven."</p>

<p>In my innocence, or rather in my ignorance, I
had always seen in these words of our Lord a
condemnation of riches&mdash;a condemnation without
appeal, and looked upon the man who sought to
be rich, and the man who did not scatter his
wealth, as persons who willingly forfeited all
chance of entering Heaven.</p>

<p>On leaving the church, my companion and I
began to talk of the sermon. The Scotch discuss
a sermon on their way home from church, as we
French people discuss the merits of a new play<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 56]</span>
that we have just seen at the theatre. As we
went along, I communicated my views to my
friend. He turned on me a glance full of compassion.</p>

<p>"It is easy to see, my dear sir," he said, "that
you have been brought up in a religion that does
not encourage discussion. The result is that you
swallow without resistance theories which would
make our children start with indignation. If
Christ's phrase could be interpreted in your
fashion, it would be neither more nor less than
an absurdity. He meant to say that it was more
difficult for a rich man than a poor one to be
saved, but not that it was impossible."</p>

<p>"But," I began, "it is impossible for a camel to
go through the eye of a needle."</p>

<p>Here my companion's smile became more sarcastic.
I foresaw that his explanation was going
to stagger me, and so it did.</p>

<p>"You seem to be in earnest," said he; "let me
enlighten you. There existed at Jerusalem, in
our Saviour's time, a gateway called the <i>Needle's
Eye</i>. Although one of the principal entrances to
the city, this gateway was so narrow that a camel
could only get through it with difficulty. So
Christ meant to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough," I cried, "my ignorance is terrible.
I never felt it so much as at this moment."</p>

<p>"You see," he added in a rather bantering tone,
"in Scotch churches there is no incense ... but
there is common sense."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>Nothing mystic in the religion of the Scotch.
The Old and New Testaments are submitted to
the finest sifting. Every passage is explained.
They are served up as an intellectual food.</p>

<p>Here people do not see because they believe;
they believe because they see. Faith is based
upon reason.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand why the Scotchman,
still more than the Englishman, is common sense
personified.</p>

<p>You will see young fellows, scarcely come to
manhood, meet together, and discuss the most
subtle questions of theology with all the earnestness
of doctors of divinity.</p>

<p>It is a powerful school. Reason ripens in the
open air of discussion.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Very practical this religion of the Scotch!</p>

<p>I extract the following passage from the letter
of a young Scotchman, magistrate in India:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Time passes tolerably here. For that matter,
we are too busy to be much bored. Week follows
week, and each is rather like the one that went
before; but all are well filled up. Last Monday, I
condemned an Indian to six months' imprisonment
and held three inquests. On Tuesday, I presided
at a meeting called for the purpose of hearing the
report of the Zanana Missions. On Wednesday,
I went to races and won &pound;25. Everyone had bet
on Mignonne, who was backed at two to one; but<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 58]</span>
seeing that the ground was damp and slippery, I
chose Ph&#339;bus, a heavier horse, backed at ten to
one. I was lucky in my choice. On Thursday,
after the work of the day, I went to see the
Nautch girls dance. It is a little <i>risqu&eacute;</i>; but I
have often heard you say that a man should see
everything, so as to be able to judge between good
and evil. There was a regatta on Friday. I went
in for one race, but only came in second. On
Saturday, I had to make out over a hundred
summonses, and try several petty offences. An
uninteresting day. It is with a feeling of apprehension
that I always await Saturday. I have
one more examination to pass before I can sentence
the natives to more than one year's imprisonment,
and two before I can send them to the gibbet. On
Sunday, I read the lessons in church. In the
afternoon I addressed a congregation out of doors.
They seemed greatly impressed, and I count on
several conversions."</p>

<p>You must admit that this was a well-filled week.
I thought the mixture of sacred and profane quite
delicious.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In Scotland, as in England, open-air services
are very common. They are conducted by good
folks, not over afflicted with modesty, who believe
that they were chosen by Heaven to go and
convert their fellow creatures&mdash;would-be St. Paul's,
operating in the Athens of the North, and elsewhere.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>Following the advice of Horace, these apostles
plunge straight into their subject. They will
attack you with the question, whether you are not
too fond of the things of this world? or else,
whether you have made your peace with God?</p>

<p>The utter conceit of these amateur clergy is
matchless. They are either hypocrites of the
worst stamp, or fanatics of the first water,
"airing their self-righteousness at the corners of
the streets." The monotony of their tunes, the
commonplaces of their would-be sermons, their
long visages, and their grimaces as they pray&mdash;all
this is the reverse of attractive.</p>

<p>I prefer the soldiers of the Salvation Army.
They are rough, but they do not banish cheerfulness
from their services. They are lively, and
break the awful silence of the British Sabbath.
Their services at first struck everyone as blasphemous;
but one gets used to everything in this
country.</p>

<p>I must not pass over the open-air orator, who, to
excuse his faults of grammar, said to his hearers,
of whom I was one: "My dear friends, I have
had no education, and I know very well I am not
a gentleman; but that does not prevent me from
accepting the mission that I have received from
Heaven to come and preach the Gospel to you.
Jesus Christ was not a gentleman&mdash;He was a
carpenter. The Apostles were not gentlemen
either&mdash;they were fishermen."</p>

<p>Modest, is it not?<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>There are Scots so sure of their salvation that
they pray but to thank God that they are not as
other men are. These Christians, whom Burns has
named the <i>unco' guid</i>, are charitable: they pray for
their neighbours. There are, on the west of Scotland,
two small islands inhabited by a race whose
piety is really touching. Every Sunday, in their
churches, they commend to God's care the poor
inhabitants of the adjacent islands of England,
Scotland, and Ireland!</p>

<p>They have their own future safety assured, and,
in their charity, think of their neighbours.</p>

<p>Donald presenting Paddy and John Bull to the
Lord! The scene is as touching as it is amusing.</p>

<p>Donald is still more religious than John Bull&mdash;that
is to say, he is still more theological and
church-going; but the fashion in which he keeps
up relations with the Divinity is very different.</p>

<p>The Englishman entertains the Jewish notion<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 61]</span>
of God&mdash;a Deity terrible and avenging, whose
very name strikes awe, and is not to be lightly
pronounced without drawing down celestial vengeance.</p>

<p>The Scot has a way of treating his Creator
very much as if He were the next-door neighbour.
He tells Him all his little needs, and will go so
far as to gently reproach Him if they are not
supplied.</p>

<p>If he has dined well, he is lavish in returning
thanks to the Lord for His infinite favours; his
gratitude is boundless. If he has had a meagre
repast, he thanks Him for the least of His mercies.
The thanks are not omitted, but at the same time
Donald gives the Lord to understand that he has
made a poor dinner.</p>

<p>The following anecdote was told me in Scotland.
The first part of it is given by Dr. Ramsay in his
<i>Reminiscences</i>, I find. As to the second, I leave the
responsibility of it to my host who related the
story to me. <i>Se non e vera, e ben trovata.</i></p>

<p>A Presbyterian minister had just cut his hay,
and the weather not being very propitious for
making it, he knelt near his open window and
addressed to Heaven the following prayer:</p>

<p>"O Lord, send us wind for the hay; no a rantin',
tantin', tearin' wind, but a noughin', soughin',
winnin' wind...."</p>

<p>His prayer was here interrupted by a puff of
wind that made the panes rattle, and scattered in
all directions the papers lying on his table.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>The minister straightway got up and closed his
window, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Now, Lord, that's ridik'lous!"</p>

<p>If this ending of the anecdote is not authentic,
I feel quite sure that none but a Scotchman could
have invented it.</p>

<p>Donald's prayers are sermons, just as the sermons
of his ministers are prayers.</p>

<p>In these daily litanies the Scotchman enters
into the most trifling details with careful forethought:
the list of favours he has received, and
for which he has to return thanks; the list of the
blessings he wishes for, and will certainly receive,
for God cannot refuse him anything,&mdash;all this is
present to his prodigious memory. He dots his
i's, as we say in France; and if by chance he
should happen to employ a rather far-fetched
expression, he explains it to the Lord, so that
there shall be no danger of misunderstanding, no
pretext for not according him what he asks for&mdash;he
corners Him.</p>

<p>Thus I was one day present at evening prayers
in a Scotch family, and heard the master of the
house, among a thousand other supplications,
make the following:</p>

<p>"O Lord, give us receptivity; that is to say,
O Lord, the power of receiving impressions."</p>

<p>The entire Scotch character is there.</p>

<p>What forethought! what cleverness! what a
business-like talent! To explain to God the signification
of the far-fetched word <i>receptivity</i>, so<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 63]</span>
that He should not be able to say: "There is a
worthy Scotchman who uses outlandish words; I
do not know what it is he wants."</p>

<p>Would not one think that this excellent Caledonian
imagined that God had been made in his
image?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>As gratitude is pretty generally everywhere&mdash;but
especially in Great Britain&mdash;a sense of favours
to come, this same Scot, before making known to
the Lord the blessings which he expected from
Him, had been careful to thank Him for past
favours. Here, too, he had been sublime. Judge
for yourself.</p>

<p>With the lady who was his third wife in the
room, he thus expressed himself:</p>

<p>"Lord, I thank Thee for the pleasure and the
comfort that I derived from the company of Jane"
(his first wife); "I thank Thee also for the pleasure
and comfort that I derived from the company of
Mary" (his second wife).</p>

<p>The third wife was there, at the other end of
the table, silent and solemn, apparently plunged
in profound meditation, and thanking Heaven for
the pleasure and comfort that the society of Jane
and Mary had given her husband.</p>

<p>When would her turn come to play her part in
these thanksgivings?</p>

<p>Her husband is but sixty-five, and I can assure
you has no idea of going yet.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>Another episode of the same kind came under
my notice in a Catholic family; but in this case
the same Scotch characteristic showed itself under
a different form&mdash;a form suggested by belief in
purgatory.</p>

<p>Here, too, the master of the house was a widower
remarried, but who had only got as far as his
second wife. Before this dutiful lady and the rest
of his family, which was composed of several big
sons and three grown-up daughters, he prayed for
the repose of the soul of his first wife, reminding
the Lord, in case He should have forgotten it,
what an angel on earth this incomparable spouse
had been.</p>

<p>"Remember, O Lord," he cried, "how discreet,
faithful, wise, careful, and obedient she was!"</p>

<p>This prayer, in my opinion, was meant to serve
two ends, for the Scotchman never loses sight of
the practical side of things. While it solicited
the admission of the first wife into Paradise, it
reminded the second of her duty towards her
husband and the virtues he expected of her.</p>

<p>Upstairs I saw that which confirmed me in my
little theory.</p>

<p>In the bedroom I occupied hung a portrait of
Mrs. X. (No. 1). Underneath the portrait a card,
illuminated with a garland of roses and foliage,
and bearing the inscription "Rest in Peace,"
announced to the stranger that the original was
no longer of this world.</p>

<p>One evening, on opening a drawer of the dress<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 65]</span>ing-table,
I beheld a card exactly similar to that
underneath the portrait, but with the inscription:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou
excelledst them all."</p></div>

<p>There it was, all ready to replace the other card,
should Mrs. X. (No. 2) cease to be "discreet, wise,
careful, and obedient." I wonder if it has seen
the light yet!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>No liturgy, no formulas for Donald, when he
prays. He will not be dictated to as to what
he shall say. He knows his own wants, and
communicates them to his Maker without reserve
or restraint.</p>

<p>The Scotch tell of a Presbyterian minister, of
the time of George III., who used to officiate in a
church in Edinburgh, and prayed for the Town
Council thus:</p>

<p>"O Lord, have mercy on all fools and idiots,
and the members of the Town Council of Edinburgh."</p>

<p>What a pity that in Paris churches it is not
possible to put up a similar petition!</p>

<p>Here is a prayer of an old farmer who lived in
the North of Scotland, and was well known for
his long and forcible addresses to Heaven.</p>

<p>"We thank Thee, Lord, for Thy great goodness
to Meg, and that it ever cam into thy heid to tak'
ony thocht o' sic a useless baw-waw as her. For<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 66]</span>
Thy mercy's sake, and for the sake o' Thy poor
sinfu' servants that are now addressin' Thee in
their ain shilly-shally way, hae mercy on Rob.
Ye ken yersel' he is a wild, mischievous callant,
and thinks nae mair o' committing sin than a dog
does o' lickin' a dish; but put Thy hook in his
nose, an' Thy bridle in his gab, an' gar him come
back to Thee with a jerk that he'll ne'er forget
the langest day he has to leeve.</p>

<p>"We're a' like hawks, we're a' like snails,
we're a' like sloggie riddles: like hawks to do
evil, like snails to do guid, and like sloggie riddles
that let through a' the guid and keep a' the bad.</p>

<p>"Bring doon the tyrant and his lang neb, for he
has done muckle ill the year; gie him a cup o'
Thy wraith, an' 'gin he winna tak that, gie him
<i>kelty</i>" (two cups, a double dose).</p>

<p>The finest and most characteristic prayer that
it has been my good luck to come across is the
following, which I have kept for a <i>bonne bouche</i>.
The good folks of Dumbarton used it in the year
1804, when the inhabitants of Scotland firmly
believed that Napoleon had resolved to invade
Great Britain:</p>

<p>"Lord, bless this house and a' that's in this
house, and a' within twa miles ilka side this
house. O bless the coo and the meal and the
kail-yard and the muckle toun o' Dumbarton.</p>

<p>"O Lord, preserve us frae a' witches and warlocks,
and a' lang nebbet beasties that gang
through the heather.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>"O build a strong dyke between us and the
muckle French. Put a pair o' branks about the
neck of the French Emperor; gie me the helter
in my ain hand, that I may lead him about when
I like: for Thy name's sake. Amen."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>To this day you will hear, in any country church
in Scotland, these interminable litanies. It is the
minister's work to watch over the interests of his
flock; he knows their wants and their wishes, and
he expresses them in his prayers. That does not
prevent Donald from going through the same process
again at home; it is always well to know
how to conduct one's own affairs.</p>

<p>Every Scot is a born preacher. Even his conversation
has a certain smack of the pulpit. By
dint of preaching and listening to preachers, his
conversation gets a sermonising turn.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>That familiarity with which Donald keeps up his
relations with his Maker&mdash;a familiarity which comes
from the good-humoured frankness of the Scotch
character&mdash;shows itself above all in the ministers
of the various religious sects of the country.</p>

<p>Thus a pastor of the Free Church, wishing to
explain how Jesus had performed a miracle in
walking across the waves to join His disciples, hit
upon this forcible way of bringing it home to his
hearers:</p>

<p>"My dear brethren, to walk on the sea is a very<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 68]</span>
wonderful thing: you would find it just as difficult
as to walk across this ceiling with your head
downwards."</p>

<p>Another, wishing to illustrate how God is everywhere
and sees everything, told his congregation:</p>

<p>"The Lord is like a moose in a dry stane dyke,
aye keekin' out at us frae holes and crannies, and
we canna see Him."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Scotch preachers of the old school knew
how to recommend their parishioners to the care
of Heaven&mdash;and occasionally to the shop of a
friend.</p>

<p>A Scotchman told me that he remembered to
have heard, when a boy, a Free Church minister
thus express himself in the pulpit:</p>

<p>"Lord, protect us from the cholera, at this time
making such terrible ravages in Glasgow; endow
the doctors of this town with wisdom; give them
also health, especially to James Macpherson, who
is getting old and cannot afford to pay a substitute.
And you, my dear friends, be prudent: keep
yourselves warm, that is the essential thing; wear
flannel clothing. If you have none at home, lose
no time in going to Donald Anderson. He has
just received from London a large stock of the
best flannels, which he is selling very cheap. I
bought some of him at a shilling a yard, and I am
perfectly satisfied with it. Donald Anderson lives
at 22 Lanark Street; don't go elsewhere."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>If the Englishman has, as I said elsewhere,
knocked down to himself the kingdom of Heaven,
which he looks upon as a British possession, the
Scotchman has discerned to himself all the best
places therein.</p>

<p>A few months ago an amiable Scotchman offered
me his hospitality in the environs of Edinburgh.
On entering my bedroom, I saw a picture of the
Last Judgment. It quite took my breath away,
the sight of that picture. And no wonder! At
God's right hand came&mdash;first, John Knox; next,
Robert Burns and Sir Walter Scott; then an
immense crowd of good folk, who, if they had
been in complete attire, would have had kilts and
plaids; and then next, but at some distance, John
Wesley and a number of other well-known English
divines; and beyond them&mdash;no one. But that
is not all. On the left hand were a good sprinkling
of popes, among people of all sorts and
conditions, but all foreigners.</p>

<p>I called my host quickly.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "what have you been up to in
this country? What! Without giving anybody
warning, without a 'by your leave,' you install
yourselves in the best seats to the exclusion of
the poor outside world! My dear sir, it looks to
me as if, when all your Britannic subjects are
supplied with places, there will be room for no
one else."</p>

<p>It was enough to make a Frenchman cry,
"Stop thief!"<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>I was fain to console myself, however, with the
thought that in France we can draw pictures of
the Last Judgment too, but with a decided improvement
on this arrangement of figures. To
look for John Knox in ours would be sheer waste
of time.</p>

<p>As to Robert Burns, who certainly was no saint,
far from it, I do not remember to have seen him,
but I guarantee that he is to be found in the midst
of the angels, beside Beethoven, Shakespeare,
Raphael, Victor Hugo, and kindred spirits.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The following anecdote, told me in Scotland,
will perhaps tend to prove that even the libations
of overnight do not hinder a true-born Scot from
believing himself in Paradise the following
morning.</p>

<p>Donald had imbibed whisky freely in the house
of a friend, and towards two in the morning set
out for home, describing wonderful zigzags as he
went.</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to him, in one of those
lucid moments which the tipsiest man will occasionally
have, that the cemetery of Kirkcaldy
formed a short cut to his house. He steered for
the place, but had not gone far when an open
grave arrested his progress. He tried to jump,
his foot caught, he slipped, and the next moment
was lying full length in the improvised bed. Here
he soon fell fast asleep. About six in the morning<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 71]</span>
the Kirkcaldy coach came speeding past, the
coachman making the air ring with a shrill
trumpet blast. Donald awakes, rubs his eyes,
and, taking it to be the Last Trump calling the
elect from their tombs, arises awe-stricken. He
looks around him. No one; not a soul!</p>

<p>"Weel, weel," cries Donald; "weel, weel, this
is a fery puir show for Kirkcaldy!!!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The French beggar accosts one with a "God
bless you." If he is blind, he plays the flute.
The Scotch beggar's stock-in-trade is generally a
Bible. For a penny he will recite you a chapter;
Old and New Testament are equally familiar to
him. If he is blind, he does the same as his
English <i>confr&egrave;re</i>: he reads aloud from a Bible
printed in raised characters.</p>

<p>Those who can get enough to invest in an organ
or a <i>discordeon</i> abandon the Bible business, which
is not lucrative. Besides, turning the handle is
easy work; whereas learning the Bible by heart
demands study.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The beggar reciting the Bible to fill his pocket
is very well; but he does not come up to the
preaching street arab.</p>

<p>A learned professor at the University of Aberdeen
told me, last February, that he was one day
accosted by a beggar-boy of about ten, who asked
him for a penny.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>"A penny! What are you going to do to earn
it?" asked the professor.</p>

<p>"Shall I sing?" replied the boy.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Shall I dance?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Shall I preach?"</p>

<p>The professor pulled out his penny without
"asking for further change."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I cannot take leave of performing beggars without
relating a little incident that I was a witness
of in Edinburgh:</p>

<p>A beggar came up to me, asking for alms.</p>

<p>"You have a violin there," I said to him; "but
you do not play it. How is that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir!" he replied; "give me a penny, and
don't make me play. I assure you you won't
regret it."</p>

<p>I understood his delicacy, and to show him that
I appreciated it launched out my penny.</p>

<p>"But," I added, "do you never use your
violin?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, sometimes," he said, lowering his
voice, "as a threat."</p>

<p>I lost my penny, but saved my ears.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 73]</span></p>

</div><p class="dropcap">he Lord's day is not called Sunday in
Scotland, but the Sabbath, which is more
biblical.</p>

<p>The Scotch Sabbath beats the English Sunday
into fits.</p>

<p>I thought, in my innocence, that the English
Sunday was not to be matched.</p>

<p>Delusion on my part.</p>

<p>How hope to give a description of the Scotch
Sabbath? It is an undertaking that might
frighten a far more clever pen than mine.</p>

<p>Happily, in this also, the Scotch anecdote
comes to my rescue.</p>

<p>Here is one, to begin with, which will show
once more how difficult it is to trip up a Scotchman.
Nothing is sacred for him when he wants
to get himself out of a difficulty.</p>

<p>A Free Kirk minister met a member of his
congregation, and thus addressed her:</p>

<p>"Mary, I am glad to have met you; for I have<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 74]</span>
something on my mind that I have been anxious
to speak to you of for a long while. I have heard&mdash;but
it surely cannot be&mdash;I have heard that you
sometimes go for a walk on the blessed Sabbath."</p>

<p>"Ay, meenister, it is quite true; but I read in
the Bible that Our Lord walked through the cornfields
on the Sabbath day."</p>

<p>"I do not deny it," replied the good man, a
little disconcerted; "but," he added, recovering
his self-possession, "let me tell you that if the
Saviour did take a walk on the Sabbath, I dinna
think the more of Him for 't."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I one day read, in an Edinburgh paper, the
following letter, addressed to the editor of the
paper by a Scotch minister. This minister had
been accused by his antagonist of having been seen
taking a walk through one of the parks on the
Sabbath.</p>

<p>What an advertisement that letter was!</p>

<p>This is how it ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Certain malevolent and unscrupulous persons have
dared to set afloat the rumour that I was seen in the
Queen's Park on the Sabbath. I utterly deny the
accusation. I never take walks on the Sabbath.
Allow me also to add that, though by going through
the park I should considerably shorten the walk from
my house to the church, I avoid doing so. Let my
enemies watch me, if they feel inclined, and they will
see that I go round."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>It seems impossible to beat that; but what do
you think of the following, which at all events
runs it close?</p>

<p>The little scene happened at Edinburgh one
Sunday.</p>

<p>My host and I were going to hear a preacher
at some distance from the centre of the town.</p>

<p>In Princes Street we hailed an omnibus.</p>

<p>I, in my simplicity, prepared to mount on the
top, when I felt someone pulling at my coat-tails.
It was my companion, who was going inside, and
who made a sign to me to follow.</p>

<p>"What! you ride inside on such a lovely day!"
I exclaimed, taking my seat at his side.</p>

<p>"On week-days it is all very well to go outside,
but on the Sabbath the interior is more
respectable."</p>

<p>The following little anecdote, which was told
me in the north of Scotland, proves that the
Highlander knows how to reconcile his scruples
with his interests, even on the Holy Sabbath
day:</p>

<p>My friend, walking one day in the neighbourhood
of Braemar, all at once perceived that he
had lost his way.</p>

<p>Meeting a peasant, he asked him to put him on
the right track.</p>

<p>"Eh!" said the rustic, "you are breaking the
Sawbath, and you are served richt. The Lord is
punishin' ye...."</p>

<p>This little sermon bid fair to last some time.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 76]</span>
My friend slipped a shilling into the peasant's
hand.</p>

<p>The effect was magical.</p>

<p>"Straight on till ye come to the crossroads, then
the second turnin' to the richt, and there ye are."</p>

<p>There is nothing like knowing how to speak
Scotch when you go to Scotland.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Yet, the real old Scotch Sabbath is almost
passing away.</p>

<p>Some lament it, others rejoice at it; but all
the Scotch admit that their forefathers would be
horrified at the things that pass in these days.</p>

<p>And indeed things must have greatly changed.</p>

<p>Now there are those who take walks on the
Sabbath. What do I say, walks? There are
those who ride velocipedes&mdash;Heaven forgive
them! There are to be seen&mdash;no offence to my
worthy host&mdash;there are to be seen poor harmless
folk degenerate enough to go and sniff the fresh
air on the top of an omnibus. They are not the
<i>unco' guid</i>, but still they are Scotch.</p>

<p>Where is the time when Scotch cooks refused to
use a roasting-jack on Sunday because it worked
and made a noise?</p>

<p>Where is the time when a Scotchman almost
found fault with his hens for laying eggs on the
Sabbath?</p>

<p>Where are the days when Donald considered it
shocking to introduce music into divine service?<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>The following little scene, of which I was a
witness, proved to me that in the Scotchman the
practical spirit is bound to assert itself. No
matter whether it is Sunday: if he does evil on
the Sabbath, he must do it well.</p>

<p>It was one Sunday afternoon in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Several children were amusing themselves (<i>proh
pudor!</i>), in a corner of Calton Hill Park, by piling
up a heap of stones.</p>

<p>When the heap was a few inches high, the
children retreated two or three yards and, each
armed with a stone, began to try and knock down
their little construction.</p>

<p>Up came a gentleman, indignant.</p>

<p>"Little scamps!" he began, "are you not
ashamed of yourselves? Don't you know you
are breaking the Sabbath?"</p>

<p>This impressive exhortation produced small
effect upon the little arabs, who went on aiming
at the heap, but without success, however.</p>

<p>By the movements of the man every time a
stone missed its aim, I could see that if the worthy
Scot was indignant at the scandalous conduct of
the boys, their awkwardness inspired him with the
most profound contempt.</p>

<p>Stone followed stone, but the heap remained
intact.</p>

<p>The Scotchman could bear it no longer.</p>

<p>"Duffers!" he cried.</p>

<p>And picking up a stone, he aimed it at the
heap, scattering it in all directions; then, with<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 78]</span>
a last pitying glance at the young admiring troop,
quietly resumed his walk.</p>

<p><i>Scotch moral.</i>&mdash;Don't play at knocking down
stones on the blessed Sabbath, it is a sin; however,
if you do not fear to commit this sin, knock
down the stones. Don't miss your aim, it is a
crime.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This practical spirit shows itself on Sundays in
many of the large towns in Great Britain.</p>

<p>In London, for instance, certain tramway companies
double the tram-fares on Sundays. The
Pharisees at the head of these companies say to
themselves:</p>

<p>"We commit a sin in working on Sundays;
let the sin be at least a remunerative one."</p>

<p>In France, our public gardens, such as the
<i>Jardin d'Acclimation</i> and many others, reduce the
price of admission on Sundays, in order to allow
the working-people and their children to take a
day of cheap and healthful recreation.</p>

<p>For a penny, I can any day of the week get
taken by tram close to the magnificent Kew
Gardens. The poor workman, who would like to
go there on Sunday, is obliged to pay twopence to
the company&mdash;one penny for his place, and another
to appease the consciences of the shareholders.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 79]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Scotch Bonhomie.&mdash;Humour and Quick-Wittedness.&mdash;Reminiscences
of a Lecturer.&mdash;How the Author was once
taken for an Englishman.</i></p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 42px;">
<img src="images/capi.jpg" width="42" height="80" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><p class="dropcap">t seems strange that in this country, so
religious as it is, most of the anecdotes
which the people are fond of relating should
refer to religion, and that the hero of them should
generally be the minister. All that joking at the
Scriptures, that parodying of the Bible, those little
comic scenes at the poor minister's expense, seem
at first sight to be in direct opposition with the
national character. It is nothing of the kind, however.
These anecdotes, which after all have in
reality nothing irreverent in them, prove but one
thing to us, and that is, that the Scotch are steeped
over head and ears in Bible, and are not sorry to
get a laugh out of it now and then: it does them
good, it is a little relief to them, and&mdash;if I may
believe Dean Ramsay, the great authority on
Scotch anecdotes&mdash;the ministers are the first to
set the example.</p>

<p>Those anecdotes, I repeat, are not irreverent:
I have heard them told by Scotchmen who would
not think of shaving on a Sunday for fear of giving
the cook extra work to boil water early. (And do
not smile if I add that in the evening, after supper,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 80]</span>
there was hot water on the table for the <i>toddy</i>. At
that hour the water had had time to boil without
occasioning any extra labour. At all events, this
is how I accounted for the phenomenon.)</p>

<p>Their anecdotes, in a word, prove that the
Scotch see a subtle, pithy point more easily than
the English, whatever these latter may say, and
that they are not so intolerant in matters religious
as they are often represented to be.</p>

<p>The further north you go in Great Britain, the
more quick-wittedness and humour you find. For
quickness in seizing the signification of a gesture,
a glance, a tone, I do not hesitate, if my opinion
have the slightest value, to give the palm to the
Scotch.</p>

<p>When, for instance, in lecturing, I remind my
audience that the English have given the British
Isles the name of "<i>United</i> Kingdom," the Scotch
shake with laughter: the little point of sarcasm
does not escape their intelligence. In England, I
am generally obliged to pause on it and give them
time to reflect; and once or twice, in the south, I
was seized with a great temptation to cry out, <i>&agrave; la</i>
Mark Twain, "Ladies and gentlemen, this is a
joke."</p>

<p>I have found all my audiences sympathetic and
indulgent; but that which provokes a laugh in
the north, often leaves the south indifferent. In
Birmingham, Yorkshire, Lancashire, in all these
great centres of British activity, and in Scotland,
that which is appreciated in a humorous lecture<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 81]</span>
is a bit of covert satire&mdash;a pleasantry accompanied
by an imperturble look: the kind of fun that the
English themselves call "dry and quiet." In the
south, you often regret to see that a broad joke
brings you a roar of applause; while some of your
pet points, those that you are proudest of, will
pass almost unnoticed.</p>

<p>Let me give you an idea of that which the
lecturer has to swallow sometimes.</p>

<p>In a room, a few miles out of London, I had
just given a lecture to the members of a literary
Society.</p>

<p>In this lecture, wishing to show to my audience
that enlightened and intelligent French people
know how to appreciate British virtues, I had
recited almost in its entirety that scene in the
<i>Prise de P&egrave;kin</i>, in which the hero, a <i>Times</i>
correspondent, walks to execution with a firm
step, defying the Emperor of China and his
mandarins with the words, "La Hangleterre il
&eacute;tait le premi&egrave;re nation du monde."</p>

<p>The lecture over, I had retired with the chairman
to the committee-room. Immediately after,
a lady presented herself at the door and asked
the chairman to introduce me to her.</p>

<p>After the usual salutations and compliments,
the worthy lady said to me pointblank:</p>

<p>"You are not a Frenchman; I knew you were
an Englishman."</p>

<p>"I am afraid the compliment is a little exaggerated,"
I responded; "certainly you cannot<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 82]</span>
make me believe that I speak English so well as
to pass for an Englishman."</p>

<p>"Oh! that is not it," she said; "but at the
end of your lecture you gave us a French quotation
with a very strong English accent."</p>

<p>I begged the lady to excuse me, as "I had a
train to catch."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Drollery of Scotch Phraseology.&mdash;A Scotchman who Lost his

<div class="figleft" style="width: 42px;">
<img src="images/capi.jpg" width="42" height="80" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><p class="dropcap">&nbsp; have spoken in a preceding chapter of
the picturesque manner in which the Scotch
people of the old school express themselves.
Here are two or three examples which will well
illustrate what I mean.</p>

<p>I one day made the acquaintance of an old
Scotch soldier. He had been present at the battle
of Waterloo, and was fond of talking about the
Napoleonic wars.</p>

<p>I started his favourite topic.</p>

<p>He described the battle of Waterloo to me
with the most remarkable clearness. It was even
touching to hear him give the details of the death
of one of his comrades whose head had been shot
off by a cannon-ball.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow," he added, "he will have to<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 83]</span>
appear at the Last Day with his head under his
arm."</p>

<p>"Were you ever wounded, yourself?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the old Scot with an imperturbable
seriousness which made it impossible to
suppose that he intended a joke; "I received two
wounds&mdash;one at Quatre-Bras and the other in the
right leg."</p>

<p>I once had a long conversation with an old lady
of eighty-two, whose grandfather had served, in
his youth, under Bonnie Prince Charlie. She
related to me all the wonderful adventures of her
ancestor, and when she had come to the end,
added, with a gravity that was sublime:</p>

<p>"He's deed noo."</p>

<p>The conversation of these Scots of the old
school is full of surprises. You must be ready for
anything. In the very middle of the most pathetic
story, out will come a remark that will make you
shake with laughter. This drollery has all the more
hold over you, because it is natural. The Scot is
too natural to aim at being amusing, and it is just
this simplicity, this <i>naturalness</i>, which disarms and
overcomes you.</p>

<p>Donald has a way of looking at things which
gives his remarks a piquancy that is irresistible:
it almost takes your breath away sometimes, you
feel quite floored.</p>

<p>A Scotch pastor was trying to give a farmer of
his parish an idea of the delights which await us
in Paradise.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, Donald," he cried, "it is a perpetual
concert. There's Raphael singing, Gabriel accompanying
him on the harp, and all the angels
flapping their wings to express their joy. Oh,
Donald, what a sublime sight! You cannot imagine
anything like it."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, but I can," interrupted Donald. "It
is just like the geese flap their wings when we have
had a lang droot, an' they see the rain a comin'."</p>

<p>In making this remark, nothing is further from
Donald's intention than to make a joke, or be
irreverent. He says it in all seriousness. It is in
this that a great charm of the Scotch phraseology
lies.</p>

<p>A friend of mine told me that he was once
walking through a churchyard with a Scotchman,
and feeling a fit of sneezing coming on, he remarked
to his companion that he feared he had
taken a cold.</p>

<p>"That's bad," replied the Scotchman, "but
there's mony a ane here who wad be glad o 't."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 85]</span></p>

</div><p class="dropcap">he hospitality of the Scotch, the simplicity
of their manners, and the authority which
the father wields, give Scotch family life
quite a patriarchal aspect.</p>

<p>The existence which the Scotch lead is a little
morose in its austerity, but it becomes these cool,
calm people, brought up in a religion that is the
enemy of joyousness, and in a climate that induces
sadness. Gaiety is produced by an agreeable
sense of existence; it is the reflection of a
generous sun in temperate climates.</p>

<p>Austerity banishes familiarity from family life
and engenders constraint. I have seen Scotch
homes where laughter is considered ill-bred, and
the joyous shouts of children are repressed. I
felt ill at ease there; that reserve inspired by an
overdrawn sense of propriety paralysed my tongue,
and I could only answer in monosyllables the
monosyllabic remarks of my host and hostess.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 86]</span>
Happily nothing more elaborate was expected of
me.</p>

<p>"Is this your first visit to Scotland?"</p>

<p>"No, I have had the pleasure of visiting Scotland
several times."</p>

<p>"Our country must seem very dull to you after
France."</p>

<p>"A little ... but I live in England."</p>

<p>"Which do you like best, England or Scotland?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Scotland, certainly."</p>

<p>"It is very cold to-day."</p>

<p>"Yes, but not colder than usual."</p>

<p>Heaven be thanked! dinner is announced, and
I offer my arm to the lady of the house.</p>

<p>It is a family dinner. My host has before him
a fine joint of beef, there are two chicken in front
of my hostess, and I am placed opposite a boiled
ham. A pair of carvers, laid with my cover, tell
me that I shall have to carve the ham which is
here eaten with the chicken. The idea is excellent;
but all at once, down go the heads almost to
the tablecloth. My host looks at the chicken, at
the ham, and lastly at the ribs of beef. His face
clouds and, bending over the beef, he growls a few
inarticulate words at it. It is not, as Mark Twain
would say, that there is anything the matter with
it, Scotch beef is the best in the world. These
words, that I was unable to catch the sense of,
were meant to invoke the blessing of Heaven on
the repast: it was Grace before meat. Very<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 87]</span>
right. I like the idea of thanking Heaven for its
favours, but why the frown?</p>

<p>A servant stands behind his master's chair,
another behind my hostess.</p>

<p>My host arms himself with his carving knife
and fork and, without relaxing a muscle of his
face, says to me:</p>

<p>"Can I assist you to a little beef?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, I think I will take a little
chicken."</p>

<p>"Can I assist you, my dear?" he said looking
at his wife.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, I will assist myself," replies
that lady.</p>

<p>"May I assist you to a slice of ham?" I ask,
seeing her put the wing of a chicken on her plate.</p>

<p>"A very small piece, please."</p>

<p>When everyone is <i>assisted</i>, conversation resumes
its little monosyllabic jog-trot, until the arrival of
the puddings and sweets, when each of us again
begins to propose to assist the other, and to think
"We will take a little of this or that."</p>

<p>The sensation of needles and pins in your legs,
the phraseology that consists in expressing one's
thoughts by <i>I think I will take a little tart, I do not
think I will take any cheese, very little of this, a very
small piece of that</i>, when one feels hungry,
those few moments of solemn suspense during
which the company look at one another waiting
for the hostess to rise&mdash;all these things give you
cold shivers.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>At last the ladies withdraw, the men are left to
themselves, and you feel a little less restrained.</p>

<p>I had already been present at many little scenes
of this kind in England, not in high society where
one finds much ease and liveliness, but in a few
middle-class houses among straight-laced people.
The little scene which I have attempted to describe
passed in a country mansion. Yet I cannot
enumerate all the delicate attentions with which
those kind Scotch people surrounded me during
my short stay among them. In most of the Scotch
houses where I had the honour of being entertained,
I found a generous and considerate hospitality,
a hospitality which was all the more
agreeable for not being overpowering. No fuss,
no noise, no frivolous politeness. On my arrival
the master of the house explained to me the
geography of his habitation.</p>

<p>"This is the smoking-room, this the library,
here is the drawing-room, and there is your bedroom.
And now, my dear sir, be at home, or get
home."</p>

<p>That is the best kind of hospitality. The
Scotchman puts all the resources of his house at
your disposition and, in a really hospitable spirit,
leaves you to use them according to your taste.</p>

<p>Several families I know of keep open house all
the year round. The friends of friends are friends,
and are always well received no matter at what
hour they may make their appearance. Some will
arrive in time for dinner, play a game of billiards<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 89]</span>
and retire. At the breakfast table, the mistress of
the house enquires of her husband how many
guests he has, and he often finds it very difficult
to answer her question.</p>

<p>I was very much amused one Sunday morning
in one of these houses. The breakfast was on the
table from nine to half-past twelve. The guests
took as much sleep as they liked and came down
when they pleased. When I thought they were all
down there were more to come. They helped
themselves to tea or coffee, and having boiled an
egg over the fire, set down comfortably to their
breakfast. Some had gone to church, others to
the library to smoke, or to the park to take the
air. Two only turned up at two o'clock to
luncheon. I should not wonder if one or two
stayed in bed all day, for I think I remember that,
at dinner-time, I saw a face or two that looked to
me like fresh acquaintances.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Good society is the same everywhere&mdash;like
hotels, as Edmond About said. It is only a
question of more or less manners in the first, and
more or less fleas in the second.</p>

<p>In Scotland fleas are rare. They would starve
on the skin of the Scotch men and are too
well-mannered to attack that of the Scotch
ladies.</p>

<p>As to good society it is no exception to the rule
here.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>To study the manners of the Scotch, as well as
to study the manners of any other nation, you
must mix with the middle classes, with the people
above all, for they are the real repository of the
traditions of the country. You must travel third-class;
there is nothing to be learnt in first. For
that matter, there is nothing alarming about that
in Scotland, their third-class carriages are superior
to our French seconds.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Scotchwoman is pretty.</p>

<p>She has not the sparkling, piquant physiognomy
of the Frenchwoman; she has not the beautiful
clear grey eyes&mdash;those eyes so dreamy and tender&mdash;of
the Irishwoman. But she looks more simple
and reserved than her English sisters, although
her manner is just as frank.</p>

<p>I have often admired Scotchwomen of a pronounced
Celtic type. They have large eyes, dark
and well shaped, with long lashes; their features
are admirably regular, they are generally rather
under middle height, with broad shoulders and
perfectly proportioned sculptural lines.</p>

<p>Red hair is common in Scotland. One sees
more of it in Edinburgh and Glasgow than in the
whole of England; but the skin is so fine, the
features are so delicate, the complexion so clear,
that the little defect passes unperceived or forgiven.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>The men are hard and sinewy.</p>

<p>In point of appearance I prefer the English
and Irish men. Scotchmen are well fitted for the
battle of life. They are useful to their country
but hardly ornamental.</p>

<p>The Scotchman is absorbed in business. In his
leisure moments he goes into politics or theology;
he studies or takes outdoor exercise. He has
little time to consecrate to women. He prefers
the company of men.</p>

<p>The women are timid, the men reserved, and if
you feel ready to undertake the burden of the
conversation, you will be listened to in Scotland;
but I cannot guarantee that you will be appreciated.
Your words are criticised, examined, and
sifted, and when you flatter yourself with the
sweet thought that you have given your host a
high idea of your conversational powers, you will
often only have succeeded in making a fool of
yourself in their eyes.</p>

<p>Never try to entertain the Scotch. Rather hear
what they have to say. Reply to their questions;
but if you would inspire them with respect, be
sober in your speech, and above all avoid dogmatising.
Leave the door of discussion always open,
so that each member of the company may enter
easily. Many Frenchmen have the bad habit of
dogmatising, as if their verdicts were without
appeal. This habit is an outcome of our frank,
impulsive character; but the Scotch would be
slow in appreciating it.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>When a Scotchman asked me&mdash;which he invariably
did&mdash;what were my political opinions, I
answered him that a monarchy has its good points,
and a republic has incontestable advantages.
That allowed each one to express himself freely
upon the two forms of government, and instead of
entertaining them, I listened, which was infinitely
more prudent, and perhaps also more profitable
for me.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I have several times been a witness of very touching
little scenes in Scotland, which proved to me that
there are hearts of gold to be found under the
rough surfaces of Scotchmen.</p>

<p>Here is one among many; it is a reminiscence
of my visit in a country seat not far from
Edinburgh.</p>

<p>"I want to introduce you to an old lady, who
wishes very much to make your acquaintance,"
said my host to me one day.</p>

<p>"Who is the lady?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It is an old servant who has been in the family
more than eighty years. It was she who brought
up my father, myself, and my children. She is
ninety-eight years old to-day, and with our care we
hope to see her live to a hundred."</p>

<p>We went upstairs, and on the third floor we
entered a little suite of apartments, consisting of
two most comfortable rooms, a bedroom and a
little parlour. There we found the <i>old lady</i>, sitting<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 93]</span>
in an arm-chair, and having a chat with one of
the young ladies of the house.</p>

<p>"Janet," said my host, "I bring you our friend
who wishes to present his respects to you."</p>

<p>"I am no as active as I was," said the good old
soul to me, "but I am wonderfu' weel for my age.
I shall soon be a hundred years of age."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said my host kissing his old nurse,
"who told you that? You have forgotten how to
count, Janet; don't get absurd ideas into your
head."</p>

<p>"We never leave her alone," he said to me;
"my wife and daughters take it in turn to pass the
day with her and amuse her. They bring their
needlework and help poor old Janet to forget time."</p>

<p>I looked around me. The walls were covered
with drawings and a thousand ornaments that
only the heart of woman knows how to invent.
Never a good dish came on the table without
Janet having her share. At night all the family met
in her little parlour for prayers and Bible reading.</p>

<p>I shook hands with the old servant and went
away greatly touched.</p>

<p>"She is no longer a servant," said my host to
me; "she has property, and all the household call
her <i>the old lady</i>. She will be buried with us. I
have already seen to the carrying out of her wishes
on this subject. She wants to lie at the feet of the
family, and has begged to have her grave made
across the foot of ours. So I have bought a piece
of ground next to our vault, and Janet's desire is<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 94]</span>
to be carried out. We hope to keep her many
years yet; we shall all miss her when she is gone."</p>

<p>All this was said without apparent emotion,
without the least ostentation.</p>

<p>"Well," I said to myself, "in Scotland more
than anywhere one must not judge people by their
exterior."</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">hat letters of recrimination I received
on the subject of a certain Scotchman
presented to the readers of <i>John Bull
and His Island</i>! What downpours!</p>

<p>Some accused me of caricaturing, some of imposture.
Others, with more delicacy, hinted
that I should do better at novel writing than at
<i>impressions de voyage</i>.</p>

<p>For a month my letter-box was besieged, and at
each <i>rat-tat</i> of the postman I used to say to myself:
"One more indignant Scotchman."</p>

<p>After all, what had I done to draw down such
thunders?</p>

<p>Here is the offending passage:</p>

<p>"A young literary Scotchman of my acquaint<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 95]</span>ance
generally passes a month once a year in the
house of his father on the outskirts of Edinburgh.
His father is a Presbyterian minister in a very
enviable position. On the day of his departure,
my friend invariably finds beside his plate at
breakfast, a little paper carefully folded: it is the
detailed account of the repasts he has taken
during his stay under the paternal roof; in other
words, his bill."</p>

<p>I never pretended to say that this kind of father
was common in Scotland. I did not say I knew
of two such fathers, I said I knew of one.</p>

<p>The Scotch have not yet digested my delicious
Papa. In all parts of Scotland I was taken to
task in the same manner.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my dear sir, own that it was not
true, confess that it was a little bit of your own
invention."</p>

<p>"His name, what is his name?" cried a few
indiscreet ones.</p>

<p>I convinced a few, a few remained undecided;
I even saw two or three go away still firmly
believing the story was a creation of my brain.</p>

<p>I can only say that my friend did not appear to
grumble at his father's treatment, for he finished
by adding:</p>

<p>"On the whole, I do not complain, the bill is
always very reasonable."</p>

<p>For that matter, I have come across a better
case still.</p>

<p>I know of a Scotch father who bought a house<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 96]</span>
for a thousand pounds and sold it to his son, six
months later, for twelve hundred.</p>

<p>That is not all.</p>

<p>The son had not the money in hand, and it was
the father who advanced the cash&mdash;at five per cent.</p>

<p>Considering the price money is at nowadays, it
was an investment to be proud of.</p>

<p>Do not imagine that the father ran the least
risk of losing the capital: he took a mortgage on
the house.</p>

<p>The son, seeing that the money had been
advanced to him at high interest, paid off his
father as quickly as he could. He is now his own
landlord, and Papa is on the look-out for another
good investment.</p>

<p>I should pity the reader, even were he a Scotchman
as seen through Sydney Smith's spectacles,
if he took this Caledonian for a typical portrait of
the Scotch father.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this volume, I compared
the Scot to the Norman, and I may say that I
have witnessed, in Normandy, little scenes of
family life which are quite a match for those
I have just described. But the actors in them
were peasants.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I am indebted to a doctor in the neighbourhood
of Aberdeen for the following anecdote:</p>

<p>"I was one day called to the bedside of an old
farmer who was dangerously ill," said the doctor<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 97]</span>
to me. "On leaving the patient's room, I took
his son aside and told him that it was useless for
me to deceive him as to the state of his father,
and that I very much feared he had not an hour
to live, or, at the best, could not outlast the day."</p>

<p>"'Are you quite sure?' said the son, scrutinising
me keenly.</p>

<p>"'I am only too sure,' I replied.</p>

<p>"I shook the young man's hands and drove
away. I had scarcely been at home an hour,
when a little cart drew up before my door. I saw
the young farmer alight from it and, a minute
later, he entered my consulting room. He held
his cap in his hand, twisting it uneasily.</p>

<p>"'Is your father worse?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'No, doctor, just the same. I have come,
because I had a little business in town ... and I
wanted to ask you at the same time.... Well,
I thought that perhaps you wouldn't mind giving
me Father's certificate of death now.... As you
say it is certain he won't pull through the day, I
suppose you don't mind whether it is to-day or
to-morrow that you give it me, and it will save me
the trouble of coming in again on purpose.'</p>

<p>"It was all I could do to make the young
fellow understand that I could not sign the
certificate of death of a man who was still alive.</p>

<p>"The old farmer died next morning at nine
o'clock.</p>

<p>"At ten, the son came to announce the news
and to ask me for the certificate."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 98]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Matrimonial Ceremonies.&mdash;Sweethearts.&mdash;"Un Serrement de
main vaut dix serments de bouche."&mdash;"Jack's kisses were
nicer than that."&mdash;A Platonic Lover.&mdash;"Excuse me,
I'm married."&mdash;A wicked Trick.</i></p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 42px;">
<img src="images/capi.jpg" width="42" height="80" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><p class="dropcap">n Scotland, matrimonial ceremonies are as
simple as they are practical. No priest,
no mayor brought into requisition; you
take God and your friends to witness. You
present your choice to these latter, and say: "I
take Mary for my wife." The girl on her part
says: "I take Donald for my husband," and there
is an end of the matter. I need not say that you
can go to Church if you prefer it.</p>

<p>Elementary as the ceremony is, the Scotchman
holds it none the less sacred for that. It is not
without long reflection that he enters into the holy
estate; and the law, which knows the sagacity
and constancy of the Scot, has not hesitated to
sanction such alliances.</p>

<p>This matrimony made easy in nowise lures the
Scot into rushing at it headlong. Young couples
sometimes remain engaged for years before they
think of taking the great step. This is often
because the man's resources are not sufficient for
housekeeping, but oftener still because the young
people want to know each other thoroughly.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>I appreciate their prudence in the first case as
much as I blame it in the second.</p>

<p>How can two affianced people know each other,
even if for years they try ever so hard?</p>

<p>Love easily lives on trifles, flirtation, sentimental
walks, <i>billets doux</i>, and so on. The sky is serene,
the lovers sail on a smooth sea. How can they
know if they are really good sailors before they
have encountered a storm?</p>

<p>When cares or misfortunes come, to say nothing
of the price of butter and the length of the butcher's
bill, then they make acquaintance. True love
resists these shocks and comes out triumphant,
but the <i>other</i> kind succumbs.</p>

<p>Let lovers see each other every week, every day,
if you will, their main pastime is the repetition of
their vows: they learn nothing of married life.
The apprenticeship has to begin all over again the
day after the wedding. Lovers may see each
other every day, it is true, but <i>every day</i> is not <i>all
day</i>. Lovers are always on their guard; they put
a bridle on their tongues; before they meet, they
are careful to look in the glass and see that nothing
is amiss with their toilet; but when they are one
each side of the bedroom fireplace, he in slippers
and smoking-cap and she in curl-papers, then
comes the test.</p>

<p>Familiarity breeds contempt, says the English
proverb. The love that is not based on deep-rooted
friendship, on solid virtues, on an amiable
philosophy, and careful diplomacy, will not survive<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 100]</span>
two years of matrimonial life. Scarcely any of
these things are called into requisition during the
courtship, and this is how <i>mariages de convenance</i>
often turn out better than love-matches. Matrimony
is a huge lottery in both cases.</p>

<p>I prefer the love-making and matrimonial processes
of England and Scotland to our own French
ones; but if I had a marriageable daughter, I
should be sorry to see her give her heart to a man
who could not marry her for several years.</p>

<p>The danger with long engagements is that they
often do not end in matrimony, and in such a
case a young girl's future is blighted.</p>

<p>I do not know if you are of my opinion, dear
Reader, but, according to my taste, making love to
a girl who has been engaged five or six years, is
like sitting down to a dish of <i>r&eacute;chauff&eacute;</i>. Seeing
the liberty that British usage accords to engaged
couples, I maintain that pure as the lady may be
and is, she is none the less a flower that has been
breathed upon and has lost some of its value.
For my part, I should always be afraid to give her
a kiss, for fear she should pout and seem to say:</p>

<p>"Jack's kisses were far nicer than that!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I extract the following anecdote from the Memoirs
of Doctor John Brown, a well-known Scotch
divine.</p>

<p>The doctor, it appears, had for six years and a
half been engaged to be married to a certain lady,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 101]</span>
when it occurred to him that matters were no
further advanced than on the day when he had
asked her for her heart and its dependencies.
The position became intolerable: the doctor had
not yet ventured on anything less ceremonious
than shaking hands with his lady-love. To touch
her hand was something, and perhaps the reverend
gentleman thought, with our French poet:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<i>Ce gage d'amiti&eacute; plus qu'un autre me touche:<br />
Un serrement de main vaut dix serments de bouche.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>However, one day, he summoned up all his
courage, and, as they sat in solemn silence, said
suddenly:</p>

<p>"Janet, we've been acquainted noo six years
an' mair, and I've ne'er gotten a kiss yet. D' ye
think I might take one, my bonnie lass?"</p>

<p>"What, noo, at once?" cried Janet rather taken by surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, noo."</p>

<p>"Just as you like, John; only be becoming and
proper wi' it."</p>

<p>"Surely, Janet, and we'll ask a blessing first,"
said the young doctor.</p>

<p>The blessing was asked, the kiss was taken, and
the worthy divine, perfectly overcome with the
blissful sensation, rapturously exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Eh, lass, but it is guid. We'll return thanks."</p>

<p>This they did, and the biographer adds that, six
months later, this pious couple were made one
flesh and lived a long life of happy usefulness.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>The following little scene, of which a friend was
witness in Scotland, will show that if Scotch
people in general can see through a joke, there are
also a few who belong to the type described by
Sydney Smith, and for whom the <i>surgical operation</i>
is a sad necessity.</p>

<p>Several persons had met together in a Scotch
drawing-room, and were passing the evening in
playing at simple games. One of these games
consisted in each person going out of the room in
turn, while the company agreed upon a word to
be guessed at by the absent member on his or her
return.</p>

<p>A young lady had just gone out of the room.</p>

<p>During her absence the word <i>passionately</i> was
chosen.</p>

<p>The young lady having been recalled, each
member of the party in turn went through a little
performance that should lead her to guess the
word, addressing her in passionate language, while
expressing with the features as much love, despair,
or anger, as possible.</p>

<p>A Scotchman, who looked ill at ease, whispered
in my friend's ear:</p>

<p>"What must I do?"</p>

<p>"Try to look madly in love," said my friend,
ready to burst out laughing at the sight of the long
serious face of his neighbour.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you suggest me something to say?"</p>

<p>"Why, make the young lady a declaration of
love. Say: 'It is useless to hide my feelings from<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 103]</span>
you any longer; I love you, I adore you,' and then
throw yourself at her feet and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said the poor fellow quite upset,
"but I'm married."</p>

<p>When the young lady came to him, he begged
her politely to excuse him, and thought himself
safe; unhappily he was not at the end of his
troubles yet.</p>

<p>My friend, whose turn came next, threw himself
on his knees, and, with haggard eyes and ruffled
hair, thus addressed her:</p>

<p>"Dear young lady, this gentleman, whom you
see at my side, is nervous and shy; he loves you
and dares not to tell his love."</p>

<p>"But, excuse me," cried the Scotchman.</p>

<p>"Listen not to him, he is dying of love. If
you do not return his flame, I know him, he will
do something desperate. Have pity on him, dear
lady, have pity."</p>

<p>"<i>Passionately!</i>" cried the young girl.</p>

<p>The worthy Scot, who had not been able to
screw up his courage to play the part of a passionate
lover, was soon after missed from the company.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 104]</span></p>

</div><p class="dropcap">f folks do not laugh much at a wedding
in Scotland, they make up for it at a
funeral.</p>

<p>Let me hasten to say, that I am sure it would be
insulting the reader's intelligence to tell him that
this applies only to the lower classes.</p>

<p>As a good Christian and a man who has led
a busy and useful life, Donald calmly contemplates
the approach of death&mdash;especially other people's.</p>

<p>Death is always near, he says to himself, and a
wise man should not be alarmed at its approach.</p>

<p>Thus fortified with wisdom, he calmly looks the
evil in the face, and lets it not disturb his little
jog-trot existence. This does not imply that he is
wanting in affection, it only means that he accepts
the inevitable without murmuring, and that in him
reason has the mastery over sentiment.</p>

<p>A <i>guid</i> wife would say to her husband in the
most natural way in the world:</p>

<p>"Donald, I do not think you have long to live.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 105]</span>
Have you any special request to make me?
Whom would you like invited to your funeral?
Do you wish Jamie to be chief mourner?" and
so on.</p>

<p>An Edinburgh lady told me that her housemaid
one morning came and asked her for leave of
absence until six in the evening, saying that her
sister was to be buried that day.</p>

<p>The permission was granted, of course.</p>

<p>The Scotch know how to keep their word. At
six o'clock precisely the maid returned, but wanted
to know whether she might have the evening free
as well.</p>

<p>"What do you want the evening for?" asked her
mistress.</p>

<p>"Oh! ma'am," replied the lassie, "the rest of
the family want to finish the day at the theatre,
and they asked me to go with them."</p>

<p>Impossible to refuse so natural a request.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This trait of the Scotch character is often to be
met with in the superior classes also.</p>

<p>Here is a very striking example of it.</p>

<p>One of my friends, an eminent professor at one
of the great English public schools, had taken to
Braemar with him a young Scotchman of great
promise whom he wished not to lose sight of
during the long summer vacation.</p>

<p>The mornings and evenings were devoted to
study. The hot afternoons were spent with Horace<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 106]</span>
and Euripides, on the bank of the Dee, in the
shade of the trees that crowd down to the water's
brink, as if they were all eager to gaze at their
own reflection in the river.</p>

<p>During the dry season the stream is fordable in
several places, and many times had the young
Scotchman crossed it.</p>

<p>Wishing to pass a week with his family before
school reopened, the pupil had told his professor
that he wished to leave Braemar before him.</p>

<p>The day before that which he had fixed for his
departure, a fearful storm had burst over the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Arrived with his knapsack on his back at the
banks of the Dee, he saw before him, not a peaceful
stream, but an angry torrent, swollen and lashed
to fury by the storm.</p>

<p>The young Scotchman was not to be intimidated.
He had crossed many times, and he would do it
again. Besides, the only other way of getting to
the station was by going two or three miles
further down and taking the boat. He prepared
to ford the stream.</p>

<p>Next day the poor young fellow's corpse, bruised
and mangled, was found a mile down the river.</p>

<p>It would be beyond my powers to describe the
despair of the professor, when he heard of the
terrible catastrophe. Entrusted with the care of
the young man, he felt as if guilty of his death.
What could he say to the unhappy parents?</p>

<p>A telegram was despatched to the father, who<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 107]</span>
arrived the day after. My friend went to meet
him at the station. What was his relief when he
heard this father say to him: "The Lord gave,
and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the
name of the Lord."</p>

<p>And he added:</p>

<p>"This sublime passage is from <i>Job</i>, first chapter
and twenty-second verse&mdash;let me see, is it the
twenty-first or the twenty-second verse? It is the
twenty-first, I am pretty sure."</p>

<p>"I fear I cannot say," replied my friend.</p>

<p>They walked, discussing the Book of <i>Job</i> the
while, to the house where lay the remains of the
unfortunate youth.</p>

<p>Do not suppose that the Scotchman ran to
imprint a farewell kiss on the brow of his dead
son. He seized upon a Bible that lay on the
drawing-room table, turned to the Book of <i>Job</i>, and
having found the passage he had quoted, said
with a triumphant look at the professor:</p>

<p>"It is the twenty-first verse&mdash;I knew I was
right."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In days gone by, Scotch funerals were made the
occasions of visiting and great drinking. During
the week that preceded the actual burying, open
house was kept for the relatives and friends of the
<i>corpse</i>,<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> and prodigious quantities of whisky were
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 108]</span>
consumed. These scenes took place among the
aristocracy and the gentry as well as among
the lower classes, and they culminated in a general
drinking bout on the day of the interment.</p>

<p>The route of the funeral procession might be
traced by the victims of Scotch hospitality to
be seen lying helplessly inebriated by the wayside,
and only a small remnant of it reached the graveyard.
More than once was the coffin, which was
carried by hand, left by the hedge, and the burial
put off until the morrow. After several stages
the defunct reached his long home.<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>To-day such scenes would excite as much disgust
in Scotland as anywhere else. Scotch manners
and customs have greatly toned down.</p>

<p>In the lower classes, however, the burial of a
relative is still an occasion for Bacchanalian
festivities, and the day is finished up, as we have
seen, at the theatre or other place of entertainment,
where a pleasant evening can be spent.</p>

<p>But what is this in comparison with that which
still goes on in Ireland in our day? That is where
the thing is brought to perfection.</p>

<p>As I fear I might be taxed with imposture, if I
attempted to give a description of the Irish wake,
I will pass the pen to an English journalist.</p>

<p>A woman having died suddenly at Waterford,
the Coroner had, according to law, ordered an
inquest. Here is the deposition of the police
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 109]</span>
constable; I extract it from my newspaper (May
8th, 1887):</p>

<p>"When I entered the house last night, I found
all the family in the room where the coffin was.
They were all drunk. The deceased had been
raised to a sitting posture in the coffin, and, by
means of cords attached to her hands and feet,
was being made to execute all kinds of marionette
performances. It was like a <i>Punch and Judy</i> show,
at which the corpse played the part of <i>Punch</i>. One
of the sons was seated near the coffin playing a
concertina. When they saw me enter, the young
men quarrelled over the body, and danced around
madly to the sound of the instrument. I had the
greatest difficulty to get possession of the corpse
for the inquest."</p>

<p>One would think one was reading a description
of some scene of life in an out-of-the-way island of
Oceania, instead of the sister-isle of civilised
England.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>One more anecdote to show that Donald views
the approach of dissolution in his neighbour,
without alarm.</p>

<p>An old Scotchman, feeling death at hand, had
bidden all his family to his bedside.</p>

<p>"I have sent for you," he said to them, "in order
to give you my last commands. I leave my house
and all that belongs to it to my son Donald, as
well as all my cattle."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>"Puir old father, he keeps his faculties to the
last," said Donald to his neighbour.</p>

<p>"As for my personal property, I desire that it
may be divided equally between...."</p>

<p>Here the old man's voice failed. He made a
last effort to speak. His children bent down to
catch his words.</p>

<p>He was dead.</p>

<p>"Puir father," cried Donald, "he is gone just
as he was beginning to rave."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Here is a touching funeral oration.</p>

<p>Donald had just had the misfortune to lose on
the same day his wife and his cow.</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor Janet," he lamented, "why have
ye left me? Wha 'll gie me back my Janet?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! you will soon get over it," said a
friend, "times cures every ill. You'll marry again
by-and-by."</p>

<p>"It may be, I dinna say no; but wha 'll gie me
back my Janet?"</p>

<p>Janet, as the reader may have divined, was the
name of the "coo."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 111]</span></p>

</div><p class="dropcap">ow active and intellectual life in Scotland
seems, in comparison with the petty and
monotonous existence led by the dwellers
in Provincial France!</p>

<p>Is it the climate that so stirs the Scotch up to
action? Possibly it may be, up to a certain point:
in a cold damp climate, a man feels it imperative
to keep his brain and body stirring; however, it
is not fair to abuse that poor Scotch climate too
much. I saw roses blooming on the walls of a
house I visited at in Helensburgh last January,
and I culled primroses in the open air in February,
at Buckie on the north coast of Scotland.</p>

<p>Scotch intellectual activity is the result of a
widespread education which is within the reach
of the poorest.</p>

<p>Enter the lowliest cottage and you will find
books there&mdash;the Bible, books on agriculture, a
novel or two, and almost invariably the poems of
their dear Burns.</p>

<p>There is no little town of three or four thousand<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 112]</span>
inhabitants but has its Literary and Scientific
Society.</p>

<p>In some cases, a rich philanthropist has come
forward with a sum of money to build a suitable
home for the Society, but very often no such
building exists, and the meetings are held in the
Town Hall, or some other public edifice of the
place.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Scotchwomen are excellent housewives. In
their leisure time they draw, write, and make
themselves acquainted with the social, religious,
and political, questions of the day.</p>

<p>They organise societies for the help of the poor,
or get up concerts in aid of the unfortunate. On
Sundays, they teach the Bible to the children of
the poor. The old maids hunt out cases of distress
and make themselves useful to the community:
they do the house-to-house visitation.</p>

<p>At any rate it is living.</p>

<p>Compare this existence with life as led in Provincial
France, where people are wrapped up in
their own family circle, take to keeping birds, and
divide their spare time between saying their
<i>pater nosters</i> and criticising their neighbours.</p>

<p>In Paris there is too much life, and in the
provinces too little. All the blood goes to the head,
and the body droops and is paralysed. It is the
initiative spirit that is wanting; for, thank Heaven,
it is neither the brain nor the money that lacks.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>I spoke of Buckie at the commencement of this
chapter. You have probably never heard of
Buckie, dear Reader. I assure you that a few
months ago I was in the same state of ignorance.
My lecturing manager had marked this little town
on my list. I was invited to lecture at Buckie, it
appeared.</p>

<p>This little hive of three or four thousand bees
looked to me, as I alighted from the train, like a
most insignificant little place.</p>

<p>The chief doctor of the town, having written to
offer me hospitality for the night, had come to the
station to meet me.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you have a Literary
Society here?" I said to him.</p>

<p>"I should think so indeed," he replied; "and a
very flourishing one it is."</p>

<p>"It is a manufacturing town, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Well, no; we have here a few well-to-do
families. The rest of the town consists of farmers,
shopkeepers, and fisherfolk."</p>

<p>"I hope the lecture-room is a small one," I
remarked.</p>

<p>"Make yourself easy about that," he replied;
"our room holds from seven to eight hundred
people, but I guarantee it will be full to-night.
They will all want to come and hear what the
Frenchman has got to say."</p>

<p>I pretended to feel reassured, but I was far from
being so.</p>

<p>His prediction was verified after all, and never<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 114]</span>
did I have a more intelligent and appreciative
audience.</p>

<p>Surely Lyons, Marseilles, Lille, Nantes, Nancy,
Bordeaux, ought to be able to do what can be
done by Buckie!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I doubt whether the Scotch are more intelligent
than the English (I mean the masses), but they
are still more energetic and persevering, much
more frugal and economical, and certainly more
intellectual; that is to say, that the pleasures they
seek after are of a higher order.</p>

<p>The Scotch are great readers.</p>

<p>In their public libraries, I have seen hundreds
of workmen and labourers thronged around the
tables, and absorbed in reading the newspapers.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Scotch papers, such as the <i>Scotsman</i>, the
<i>Glasgow Herald</i>, the <i>Glasgow News</i>, the <i>British Mail</i>,
are in no wise behind the London papers in importance
or in literary merit. They have their
own correspondents in all the capitals of the
world, and get the news of the day at first
hand.</p>

<p>Comic papers are remarkable by their absence.
The Scot does not throw away his time and money
on such trifles.</p>

<p>On the other hand, religious papers swarm and
make their fortune.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>The famous <i>Edinburgh Review</i> has perhaps no
longer quite the reputation it used to enjoy, but it
is still one of the most important <i>Reviews</i> of Great
Britain.</p>

<p>Yes, in all truth, Scotland is an energetic, robust,
and intelligent, nation.</p>

<p>It is the sinew of the British Empire.</p>

they differ from English Universities.&mdash;Is he a Gentleman?&mdash;Scholarships.&mdash;A
Visit to the University of Aberdeen.&mdash;English
Prejudice against Scotch Universities.</i></p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 53px;">
<img src="images/caps.jpg" width="53" height="80" alt="S" title="S" />
</div><p class="dropcap">cotland boasts four universities:
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and St.
Andrew's.</p>

<p>These four great centres of learning constitute
the system of Higher Education in Scotland.</p>

<p>These universities differ essentially from the
two great English ones, first because men go there
to work, secondly because they are open to the
people. A peasant's son, like Thomas Carlyle for
instance, can go there without fearing that his
fellow-students will avoid him because he comes
of a poor family.</p>

<p>When a new student arrives at Oxford or
Cambridge, the others do not enquire whether<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 116]</span>
he is a clever fellow or a dunce; what they want
to know is what his father is, and who was his
grandfather. It is only after obtaining a satisfactory
answer to these questions that they
associate with the new comer.</p>

<p>In Scotland, as in France, every man who is
well educated and has the manners of good
society is a gentleman. The son of a peasant
possessing these is received everywhere.</p>

<p>Each Scotch university offers from fifty to
eighty scholarships, varying in value from &pound;8 to
&pound;70. These sums, paid annually to the winners
of the scholarships, help them to live while they
are devoting their time to study.</p>

<p>The most admirable thing about high education
in Scotland is that it is put within the reach of all,
and is not, as it is in England, a sugarplum held
so high as to be often unattainable.</p>

<p>The result is that every intelligent young Scotchman
may aim at entering a profession. There
may be in this a little danger to the commerce and
agriculture of the country. However, these young
men do not encumber Scotland; their studies fit
them for a lucrative career, which they often go
and seek in the Colonies. An Australian friend
told me recently that more than half the doctors
in Victoria were Scotchmen.</p>

<p>I have spoken, in a previous chapter, of the
privations that Scotch undergraduates will often
impose upon themselves. Nothing is more remarkable
than the sustained application and<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 117]</span>
indefatigable will which they bring to bear on
their studies. Nothing distracts them from their
aim; they never lose sight of the diploma that
will be their bread-winner. I have seen them at
work, these Scotch students. I visited the School
of Medicine at Aberdeen University, in the company
of Dr. John Struthers, the learned Professor
of Anatomy. I was struck, in passing through
the dissecting room, to see about fifty students,
without any professor, so absorbed in their work
that not one of them lifted his head as we
passed.</p>

<p>In France it would have been very different:
every eye would have been turned to the stranger,
and all through the room there would have been a
whisper of <i>Qui &ccedil;a</i>? And then remarks and jokes
would have run rife.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The English are very prejudiced against the
Scotch universities.</p>

<p>How many times have I been told in England
that young fellows, who fail to obtain their
medical diploma in England, could get them
easily enough in Scotland. Nothing is more
absurd; if ever it was so, it was a long while ago.
In these days, the examinations of the four Scotch
faculties are quite as severe and quite as difficult
as the English ones.</p>

<p>Whenever there is a vacant mastership in an
English public school advertised in the news<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 118]</span>papers,
it is always stated that the candidates for
the post must be graduates of one of the universities
of the United Kingdom. This does not
alter the fact that candidates, who are not Oxford
or Cambridge men, have no chance of being
elected. I have known Scotch masters in the
public schools. They had studied at Edinburgh,
Glasgow, or Aberdeen, but had gone to Oxford or
Cambridge to reside, in order to obtain an English
degree.</p>

<p>Why is this?</p>

<p>Simply because these two great English universities
give their old scholars an importance, not
necessarily literary or scientific, but social; they
stamp them gentlemen.</p>

<p>Whatever the English may say, the universities
of old Scotland are the nurseries of learned and
useful citizens. Of this they would soon be convinced
if they would visit those great centres of
intellectual activity. But this is just what they
avoid doing. When the English go to Scotland,
it is to fish or to shoot in the Highlands, and
whatever they may get in the way of game or fish,
they do not pick up much serious information on
the subject of Scotland.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 119]</span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 53px;">
<img src="images/caps.jpg" width="53" height="80" alt="S" title="S" />
</div><p class="dropcap">cotland possesses a national literature
of which the greatest nations might justly
be proud.</p>

<p>To take only the great names, it may safely be
said that more touching and sublime poetry than
that of Burns was never written, that Walter
Scott was the greatest novelist of the century, that
Thomas Carlyle has never been surpassed as a
historian and essayist, and that Adam Smith's
<i>The Wealth of Nations</i> can be considered as the
basis of modern political economy.</p>

<p>I pass over the Humes, Smolletts, and other
illustrious representatives of Scotch literature,
on whom I certainly do not intend to write an
essay.</p>

<p>But how can one speak of Scotland without
devoting a few words to Robert Burns? In their
worship of their great poet I see a trait characteristic
of the Scotch people.</p>

<p>Scotland is above all things full of practical
common sense, but it is steeped to the brim in
poetry. There is poetry at the core of every Scot.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 120]</span>
Visit the castle of the rich, or the cottage of the
poor, or step into your hotel bedroom, and you
will see the portrait of the graceful bard.</p>

<p>I happened to be in Edinburgh on the 25th of
January, the anniversary of Burns' birth. The
theatres were empty. Everyone was celebrating
the anniversary. Dinners, meetings, lectures were
consecrated to Burns; and that which was passing
in Edinburgh was also passing, on a small scale,
in every little Scotch village.</p>

<p>It was a national communion.</p>

<p>Burns wrote in Scotch, and in celebrating the
anniversary of his birth, they celebrated a national
f&ecirc;te. His poetry reminds them that they belong
to a nation perfectly distinct from England, a
nation having a literature of her own. This is
why his memory is revered by high and low alike.
The Scotch could no more part with their Burns
than England with Shakespeare, or Italy with
Dante. The Gaelic tongue is rapidly dying out,
Scotch customs become more and more English
every day, but each year only adds to the glory of
Robert Burns. His poems have run rapidly through
many editions&mdash;they have reached more than a
hundred up to now&mdash;the sad story of his life is
retold every year, and his portrait is still in great
demand. The popularity Burns still enjoys in
Scotland may be judged from the fact than in one
single shop in Edinburgh there are twenty thousand
portraits of the poet sold annually.</p>

<p>Whilst the English allow the house which<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 121]</span>
Carlyle inhabited for so many years at Chelsea to
go to ruins, the Scotch take a pride in showing the
stranger the little clay cottage where Burns first
saw the light on the 25th of January, 1759.</p>

<p>It is with real regret that I turn from the subject
of the "Ayrshire Ploughman," his life and his
works. Few poets have united as he has, delicate
pathos and comic force, pure <i>r&ecirc;verie</i> and the sense
of the grotesque. But after all, I should but do
what has been done over and over again by his
numerous biographers, the chief of whom are
Carlyle, Chambers, and Professor Shairp.</p>

<p>Longfellow has said that what Jasmin, the
author of the <i>The Blind Girl of Castel Cuill&eacute;</i>, was
to the south of France, Burns was to the south of
Scotland: the representative of the heart of the
people.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Nothing can be more suave, piquant, and
picturesque than the wild and primitive melodies
of the songs of Scotland. The Scotch ballad is
the spontaneous production of the touching and
simple genius of the nation.</p>

<p>The words are full of pathos and rustic humour.
The music is light, often plaintive, always graceful.
The whole has a delicious perfume of the
mountain. I know of no other kind of song to
compare with it, unless it were perhaps the songs
of the Tyrol and a few <i>Breton</i> ballads.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>The verses of Burns and other Scotch poets
have inspired some of the greatest musicians.
Mendelssohn was a great admirer of them.</p>

<p>Madame Patti delights to charm her audiences
with "Comin' thro' the rye," or "Within a mile o'
Edinbro' town," and these vocal gems suit the
supple voice of the inimitable songstress; they
even suit her very person, as she sings them in her
arch manner, and finishes up with a saucy little
curtsey.</p>

<p>The songs of Scotland, old as they are most of
them, have lost nothing of their freshness. They
are still the delight of the nation.<a name="FNanchor_A_5" id="FNanchor_A_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

pastoral character of this exercise.</p>

<p>Nothing is more graceful than the reel and
schottische of the Highlands.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>The reel demands great agility. Two swords
are placed crosswise on the ground and, to the
sound of bagpipes, Donald executes double and
triple pirouettes in and out, carefully avoiding the
weapons.</p>

<p>Ask me how Society dances in Scotland and I
will answer: just as it does elsewhere, but with a
gravity that would do honour to our senators.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Scotch are not all agreed as to whether
dancing is sinful or not.</p>

<p>Certain dwellers in the Highlands look on it as
the eighth deadly sin; the Shakers, on the
contrary, consider it as the most edifying of religious
exercises.</p>

<p>Between the two, the margin is wide.</p>

<p>Socrates, the wisest of men in the eyes of
Apollo, admired this exercise and learned dancing
in his old age. Homer speaks of Merion as a good
dancer, and adds that the grace and agility he
had acquired in dancing rendered him superior to
all the Greek and Trojan warriors.</p>

<p>Dancing was among the religious acts of the
Hebrews, Greeks, and Egyptians. The early
Fathers of the Church led the dance of the children
at solemn festivals.</p>

<p>The holy king David danced in front of the
Ark, as we know by the Scriptures.</p>

<p>Real virtue is amiable, and tolerance and gaiety
are its distinguishing marks.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>For my part, I know no more charming sight
than those village dances, becoming, alas! more
and more rare. Boys and girls gave themselves
up to mirthful pleasure without thought of harm,
and these pastoral f&ecirc;tes kept alive joy and innocence
in the hearts of our villagers. We are
growing too serious, the railways and telegraph
have upset us and enervated us, we are getting
languid and dull.</p>

<p>If I am to believe the Scotch, with whom I
have talked on the subject, it is not dancing that
they object to, it is the fashion in which people
dance nowadays. They admire the contre-dance
and minuet, but consider it improper that a man
should whirl round a room with a half-dressed
lady in his arms.</p>

proverbs, those time-honoured oracles of
the wisdom of nations.</p>

<p>And, indeed, Scotland, the home of moral<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 125]</span>
phrases <i>par excellence</i>, owns more than three
thousand proverbs.</p>

<p>These proverbs show up all the characteristics
of the Scotch people, their prudence, caution,
sagacity, self-confidence, and knowledge of human
nature.</p>

<p>Several of them are not exclusively Scotch,
whatever the Scotch people may say. We have, in
Normandy, many which may differ slightly in the
wording, but which express the same ideas, a fact
which shows once more how many traits of character
the Scot has in common with the Norman.</p>

<p>Here are a few:</p>

<p><i>Mony smas mak a muckle.</i> The French say "Little
streams make big rivers."</p>

<p><i>Anes payit never cravit</i> (no more debts, no more
bothers). The French go further when they say:
"A man is the richer for paying his debts." I am
afraid the truth of this adage might fail to strike
the Scotchman at first sight. The only privilege
of a proverb is to be incontestable. This French
proverb smacks of the sermon, it oversteps the
mark.</p>

<p><i>A cat may look at a king.</i> One man is as good
as another. This illustrates the independence of
the Scotch character.</p>

<p><i>Be a frien' to yoursel', an sae will ithers.</i> "Help
yourself and Heaven will help you."</p>

<p><i>We'll bark oursels ere we buy dogs sae dear.</i> A good
maxim of political economy: "Don't pay others
to do what you can do for yourself."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p><i>A' Stuarts are na sib to the King</i>: All Stuarts are
not related to the King. The French say: "The
frock does not make the monk."</p>

<p><i>Guid folk are scarce, tak care o' me.</i> The Normans
say: "Good folks are scarce in the parish, take
care of me."</p>

<p><i>He that cheats me ance, shame fa' him; he that
cheats me twice, shame fa' me.</i> A proverb that well
illustrates Scotch caution.</p>

<p>The fear of the devil has inspired many Scotch
proverbs, which are in constant use still.</p>

<p><i>The de'il's nae sae ill as he's caaed.</i> A delicate little
compliment to his Satanic Majesty: the Scot is
right, one never knows what may happen, it is as
well to make friends with the mammon of unrighteousness.
A personage who receives so few
compliments is likely to remember with pleasure
the folks who pay them.</p>

<p>The same neat spirit of flattery is visible in the
following proverb:</p>

<p><i>It's a sin to lee on the de'il.</i></p>

<p><i>The de'il's bairns hae de'il's luck, and the de'il's aye
gude to his ain</i>, are used to hurl at people who
excite jealousy by their success.</p>

<p>Scotch sarcasm is well illustrated in such a
proverb as:</p>

<p><i>Ye wad do little for God gin the de'il war deid.</i> This
is reducing the <i>unco' guid</i> to the level of devil
dodgers.</p>

<p><i>It's ill to wauken sleepin' dogs.</i> This is rather hard
on the dog, who certainly cannot be considered the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 127]</span>
emblem of wickedness and hypocrisy. In France
we say: "Do not waken the sleeping cat," and I
think with more show of reason.</p>

<p>The following is full of poetry:</p>

<p><i>The evening bring a' hame.</i> The evening brings
the family together around the hearth, and in the
evening of life man turns his thoughts homewards,
forgets the faults of his neighbours, and lays aside
disputes and strivings.</p>

<p><i>Let him tak a spring on his ain fiddle</i>, says a proverb
that illustrates the coolness with which Donald
will bide his time. A lawyer, who had to listen to
an eloquent tirade of an opponent in court, contented
himself with remarking: "Aweel, aweel,
sir, you're welcome to a tune on your ain fiddle;
but see if I dinna gar ye dance till't afore it's
dune."</p>

<p>The same idea occurs in:</p>

<p><i>Ne'er let on but laugh i' your ain sleeve.</i></p>

<p><i>A travelled man has leave to lee</i>: Folks will not go
to far countries to prove his words. O Tartarin
de Tarascon!</p>

<p><i>Better learn by your neighbour's skaith than your ain
skin.</i> So might Cleopatra have said when she tried
the effect of poisons on her slaves before making
her own choice.</p>

<p><i>Drink little that ye may drink lang</i>, is a piece of
advice Donald has well laid to heart, only he has
modified the first part considerably.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I think I have quoted enough proverbs to prove<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 128]</span>
that the Scot has the measure of his neighbour,
and knows how to make use of him.</p>

<p>Most of them have a smack of realism which
shows that Donald has a serious aim in life, that
of being a successful man.</p>

<p>Even the use he makes of the precepts of the
Bible proves it. He uses his Bible, but adapts to
his purpose the lessons he finds therein.</p>

<p>The Bible is his servant rather than his master,
and has this good about it, that with a little
cleverness it can be made to prove anything.</p>

<p>If he sometimes come across a precept which is
perfectly clear and irrefutable, Donald does not
scruple to ignore it.</p>

<p>I was talking with a Scotchman one evening
about the different religions of the world, and I
remarked to him that when the Mussulmans call
us "dogs of Christians," it is not because we are
Christians, for they are admirers of the Christian
religion, but simply because we do not follow the
precepts of Christianity.</p>

<p>"The Mussulmans are quite right," I said,
"Christianity is the grandest thing in the world;
but Christians are mostly 'Pharisees and hypocrites'
who believe little in their religion and act
up to it still less."</p>

<p>He, on the contrary, maintained that Christians
were no less admirable than their faith, that they
followed the precepts contained in the Sermon on
the Mount to the letter, and finally that of all
Christians the Scotch were the cream.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>We argued long without either of us convincing
the other, and I must admit that my host, who
was a much cleverer theologian than myself, had
the last word.</p>

<p>In taking leave of him that night, I was bold
enough to return to the charge. "Come, my dear
sir," I began, "if we receive a blow on our right
cheek, the Scriptures command us to offer our left
also. If a man struck you on the right cheek, now
what would you do?"</p>

<p>"What would I do?" he said after drawing a
great whiff at his pipe. "What would I do? By
Jove, I'd give him two that he wouldn't soon forget,
I can tell you!"</p>

<p>I shook hands with my host, and retired in
triumph.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">he Scotch may be recognised at the first
word by the very strong,<a name="FNanchor_A_6" id="FNanchor_A_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> sonorous
accent with which they speak English.
It is like a German accent with the <i>r</i>'s of the
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 130]</span>
Normans. In the North of Scotland, the accent
is so Teutonic that one seems to be listening to
Germans talking English. The letters <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, and
<i>v</i> are changed into <i>p</i>, <i>t</i>, and <i>f</i>. The <i>ch</i> is perfectly
German at the end of a word, such as <i>loch</i>. <i>Ght</i>
becomes <i>cht</i>, and is pronounced as in the German
word <i>nacht</i>.</p>

<p>Certainly there is nothing insurmountably difficult
to understand in all this; but that rogue of a
Donald has a way of eating the ends of many of
his words, of running the mutilated remains in
together with such bewildering rapidity, and accompanying
the whole with such a tremendous
rolling of <i>r</i>'s, that the stranger is completely staggered
until his ear grows accustomed to the
jargon.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The English language is composed of about
forty-three thousand words, out of which fourteen
thousand are of Germanic origin, and twenty-nine
thousand have come into it from the Latin
through the Norman dialect. But in Scotland
you will hear the people using numbers of modern
French words, which are no part of the English
vocabulary. These words are remnants of the
close relations that existed between France and
Scotland in the sixteenth century. They are
mostly heard now in the mouths of the older
inhabitants.</p>

<p>For nearly a hundred years past the English<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 131]</span>
have been continually borrowing words from us
(a loan which we return with interest), but they
are words which will only be found in use among
the upper classes. The case is different in Scotland.
There the French words were adopted by
the people, and it is the people that still use them,
and not the better educated classes, for these
latter avoid them as vulgar. In a hundred years
they will probably have fallen into disuse. It
may not therefore be out of place to give here
a list, which I think is pretty complete, of the
French words that form the last trace of an alliance
which has left to this day a very pronounced
sentiment of affection for France in the hearts of
the Scotch.</p>

<p>There were doubtless many others in use formerly,
but I have collected only those which may
still be heard in everyday use among the Scotch
populace:</p>

<p>These are not, as may be seen, words borrowed
from our milliners and dressmakers; they are terms<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 133]</span>
that express the necessaries of life, and which the
Scotch housewives have not yet forgotten. They
prove in an irrefutable manner that the two nations
mixed and knew each other intimately.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The language spoken by the Scotch lends itself
to humour. Their picturesque pronunciation gives
their conversation a piquancy which defies imitation.
A Scotch anecdote told in Scotch language
never misses its effect. Tell it in English, or any
other language, and it loses all its raciness.</p>

<p>As I have already remarked, the Scot does not
seek to appear witty, still less amusing, and there
lies the charm. His remarks are not intended to
be quaint, but are intensely so. Their drollery
lies in the dialect and the combination of ideas.
The Scotch are quick to seize the humorous side
of things, and that without being aware of it.
Their remarks are made with an imperturbable
gravity, without a gesture, or the movement of a
muscle.</p>

<p>I fancy I see still the old Scotch servant with
whom I was speaking on the subject of a fire
which would not burn in my room at a hotel.
All at once she interrupted the conversation; she
had just perceived, on the top of my head, a
somewhat solitary lock of hair.</p>

<p>"Are ye growin' a moustache on the top o'
your heid?" she exclaimed without a smile.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>My first impulse was to bid her mind her business,
and make my fire draw. But though I disliked
the familiarity, I saw immediately that the
good creature, a bony Scotchwoman of at least
fifty summers, had not had the least intention of
joking me, still less of vexing me. Her stolid
expression, her quaint accent, to say nothing of
the incongruous idea that had come to her lips, it
all diverted me intensely, and I laughed well over
it to the great astonishment of the worthy woman,
who went away grumbling at the fire which had
proved very obdurate.</p>

<p>The chimney continued to smoke horribly, and
presently I rang the bell again.</p>

<p>The woman reappeared.</p>

<p>"This chimney smokes atrociously still," I said.</p>

<p>You should have seen her dry old face as she
simply remarked:</p>

<p>"Eh, mony a ane has complained o' that
chimney."</p>

<p>The familiarity of the Scotch servant is an old
theme. The good humour of the master in Scotland
encourages familiarity in the servant, and
the fidelity of the latter causes it to be overlooked.</p>

<p>I remember the dinner-gong had been sounded
in a house where I was one day visiting, and not
being quite ready, I was still in my room. Someone
knocked at my door. It was an old servant.
"Noo," said she, "it's time to come doun to your
dinner."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>Scotch wit is cutting, there is often a sarcastic
thrust in it, sometimes even a little spice of
malice.</p>

<p>You hear none of those good broad bulls, brimming
over with innocence, that are so amusing in
the Irish; the Scotch witticisms are sharp strokes
that penetrate and strike home.</p>

<p>Lunardi, the aeronaut, having made an ascent
in his balloon at Edinburgh, came down on the
property of a Presbyterian minister in the neighbourhood
of Cupar.</p>

<p>"We have been up a prodigious way," said the
aeronaut to the minister; "I really believe we
must have been close to the gates of Paradise."</p>

<p>"What a pity you did not go in!" replied the
Scotchman, "you may never be so near again."</p>

<p>I might give numerous examples of this sarcastic
wit that so often underlies Scotch anecdotes.
I will only cite one more. This time we
have Robert Burns for hero, and I extract the
story from his biography:</p>

<p>The celebrated poet was one day walking on
Greenock pier, when a rich tradesman, who happened
to be there also, slipped and fell in the
water. Being unable to swim, he would have
been drowned but for the bravery of a sailor who
threw himself, all dressed as he was, into the
water, and brought him to land.</p>

<p>When the tradesman had regained consciousness
and recovered from his fright, he bethought
himself that he ought to reward his rescuer.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 136]</span>
Putting his hand in his pocket, he drew out a
shilling, which he generously presented to the
brave sailor.</p>

<p>The crowd that had gathered round in admiration
of the sailor's heroic act could not restrain
its indignation. Protestations were followed by
hoots, and the object of their scorn came very
near being returned to the water&mdash;to learn his
way about.</p>

<p>Robbie Burns, however, succeeded in appeasing
their wrath.</p>

<p>"Calm yourselves," said he; "this gentleman
is certainly a better judge of his own value than
you can be."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 42px;">
<img src="images/capi.jpg" width="42" height="80" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><p class="dropcap">n Scotland, the staff of life is porridge,
pronounced <i>parritch</i> by the natives.</p>

<p>Porridge is served at breakfast in every
Scotch home, from the castle to the cottage. It is
the first dish at breakfast, or the only one, according
to the income.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>Porridge is a food which satisfies and strengthens,
and which, it seems, is rich in bone-forming
matter.</p>

<p>Many a brave young Scotch undergraduate,
with rubicund face and meagre purse, breakfasts
off a plate of porridge which he prepares for
himself, while <i>ces messieurs</i> of Oxford breakfast like
princes.</p>

<p>I saw a labourer near Dumfries, who, on his
wages of twelve shillings a week, was bringing up
a family of eight children, all of them robust and
radiant with health, thanks to porridge. The
eldest, a fine fellow of eighteen, had carried off a
scholarship at Aberdeen University. In England,
no professional career would have been open to
him.</p>

<p>Few of the lower class English people will
condescend to eat porridge; they will have animal
food twice a day, if they can get it, and beer
or other stimulants. Twenty years of prosperity
and high wages have spoiled, ruined the working
class in England. Now wages have fallen, or
rather work has become scarce, and these people,
who never thought of saving anything in the days
of their splendour, are plenty of them lacking
bread. They are not cured for all that. If you
offered them porridge, they would feel insulted.
"It is workhouse food," they will tell you.</p>

<p>When the Scotch maidservant receives her
wages, she goes and puts part in the Savings
Bank, like the French <i>bonne</i> of the provinces.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 138]</span>
When the English servant takes up hers, she
straightway goes and buys a new hat to get
photographed in it. Money burns her pockets.</p>

<p>Money is round, say the English, it was meant
to roll; money is flat, say the Scotch and the
Normans, it was meant to be piled up.</p>

<p>When he is in work, the workman of London,
Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, will spend
three or four shillings a day on his keep; when he
is out of work, he stands about the tavern-door
and whines for help.</p>

<p>I visited one day, in Aberdeen, a restaurant
where a copious repast was being served for the
modest sum of two pence a head. The room was
full of healthy-looking workmen, tidily dressed
and busily doing honour to the porridge and other
items on the <i>menu</i>.</p>

<p>The bill of fare for the week was posted up at
the door. Here is a copy of it:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"<i>Monday</i>&mdash;Porridge, sausage and potato.<br />
"<i>Tuesday</i>&mdash;Scotch broth, beef pie.<br />
"<i>Wednesday</i>&mdash;Peasoup and ham.<br />
"<i>Thursday</i>&mdash;Porridge, sausage and potato.<br />
"<i>Friday</i>&mdash;Fish and potato.<br />
"<i>Saturday</i>&mdash;Porridge, sausage and potato."<br />
</p></div>

<p>A trifle monotonous, perhaps, this bill of fare, I
own; but, at all events, you will admit that for
twopence the Aberdeen workman can have a good
square meal.</p>

<p>What would the Parisians have given for this
fare during the siege!<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>On the walls, I observed the following notice:</p>

<p>"The public are respectfully requested to pay
in advance, so as to avoid mistakes."</p>

<p>"To avoid mistakes!" Thoroughly Scotch
this little caution!</p>

<p>I had always seen porridge eaten before the
other food. So seeing a worthy fellow ask that
his porridge might be brought to him after his
sausage and potato, I made bold to ask him the
explanation of it.</p>

<p>"Do you take your porridge after your meat?"
I enquired.</p>

<p>"Ay, mon," he replied, "it's to chock up the
chinks."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Ask a Scotch rustic what he takes for breakfast,
and he will answer proudly:</p>

<p>"Parritch, mon!"</p>

<p>And for dinner?</p>

<p>"Parrritch!!"</p>

<p>And for supper?</p>

<p>"<i>Parrrritch!!!</i>"</p>

<p>If he took a fourth meal, he would roll in
another <i>r</i>; it is his way of expressing his sentiments.</p>

<p>I like people who roll their <i>r</i>'s: there is backbone
in them.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Robert Burns, who has sung of the haggis and
the whisky of his native land, has only made<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 140]</span>
indirect mention of porridge. He ought to have
consecrated to it an ode in several cantos.</p>

<p>Porridge! it is the secret of the Scot's success.
Try to compete with a man who can content
himself with porridge, when you must have your
three or four meals a day and animal food at two
of them.</p>

<p>It is porridge that gives a healthy body, cool
head, and warm feet;</p>

<p>Porridge promotes the circulation of the blood;</p>

<p>It is porridge that calms the head after the
libations of overnight.</p>

<p>It is porridge that keeps the poor man from
ending his days in the Union.</p>

<p>It is porridge that helps the son of the humble
peasant to aspire to the highest career, in allowing
him to live on a scholarship at the University;</p>

<p>It is porridge that makes such men of iron as
Livingstone and Gordon;</p>

<p>And, above all, it is porridge that puts the
different classes in Scotland on a footing of
equality once a day at least, and thus makes of
them the most liberal-minded people of Great
Britain.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The national drink of Scotland is Scotch
whisky.</p>

<p>The Scotch will tell you that Irish whisky is no
good; the Irish will tell you that Scotch whisky
is simply detestable. I have tasted both, and,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 141]</span>
having no national prejudice on the point, have
no hesitation in saying that there is nothing to
choose between them: both are horrible.</p>

<p>Whisky may easily be obtained by dissolving a
little soot in brandy. As the coal-smoky taste is
much more pronounced in the Scotch whisky than
in the Irish, I conclude that, in the latter, the dose
is smaller.</p>

<p>They say that of all alcoholic liquors whisky is
the least injurious. By "they" must be understood
all the good folks who cannot do without this
beverage. There must, however, be truth in it, or
Scotland and Ireland must have been depopulated
long since. And, as we know the Scotch generally
live to a good old age, and centenarians are
not rare in the Land o' Cakes, if whisky be a
poison, it must be a slow one&mdash;a very slow
one.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The prettiest anecdote, in Dean Ramsay's
<i>Reminiscences</i>, relates to whisky, and I cannot
refrain from quoting it.</p>

<p>An old Scotch lady had just sent for her gardener
to cut the grass on her lawn.</p>

<p>"Cut it short," she said to him; "mind, Donald,
an inch at the bottom is worth two at the top."</p>

<p>Always the same way of speaking in moral
sentences so common in Scotland.</p>

<p>The work done, the good lady offered Donald a
glass of whisky, and proceeded to pour it out,<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 142]</span>
but showed sign of stopping before the top was
reached.</p>

<p>"Fill it up, ma'am, fill it up," said the shrewd-witted
fellow, "an inch at the top is worth twa at
the bottom."</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">ere I pause, dear Reader.</p>

<p>An idea has just come to my head, and
for fear it might be lonely there, I will
impart it to you without delay.</p>

<p>Now, to come at once to the sense of the
matter, will you allow me for once&mdash;for once
only&mdash;to pay myself a compliment that I think
I well deserve? It is the word "Ireland,"
which I have just written in the preceding chapter,
that makes me think of addressing sincere congratulations
to myself. Forgive me for this little
digression, it will relieve me.</p>

<p>I have written two books on England, a third on
the relations between England and France, and I
shall soon have finished a volume of recollections
of Scotland.</p>

<p>How many times I have had to write the words
"England" and "Ireland," I could not say; but
I affirm that I have not once&mdash;no, not once<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 143]</span>&mdash;spoken
of "Perfidious Albion" or the "Emerald
Isle."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" and "What of that?" you will
perhaps exclaim.</p>

<p>Well, whatever you may say, I assure you that
if ever a man had a right to feel proud of himself,
I have.</p>

<p>More than once have I been tempted, once or
twice I have had to make an erasure, but I am the
first who has triumphed over the difficulty.</p>

<p>Come, dear Critic, if thou wilt be amiable, here
is an occasion. Admit that a Frenchman, who
can write fourteen or fifteen hundred pages on the
subject of England, without once calling her
"Perfidious Albion," is a man who is entitled to
thy respect and thy indulgence for the thousand
and one shortcomings of which he knows himself
to be guilty.</p>

like London," Glasgow must be very much
like the dungeon where Satan shuts up those
who do not behave themselves.</p>

<p>The word "Glasgow" is of Celtic origin, and,
it appears, means <i>Sombre Valley</i>.</p>

<p>The town has not given the lie to its name.</p>

<p>I have travelled from the south of England to
the north of Scotland; I have seen every corner
of the great towns, and I do not hesitate to give
the palm to Glasgow: it is the dirtiest, blackest,
most repulsive-looking nest that it was ever given
to man to inhabit.</p>

<p>I am bound to say that the Scotch themselves,
so justly proud of their old Scotland, dare not
take it upon themselves to defend Glasgow: they<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 145]</span>
give it over to the visitor, not, however, without
having added, as a kind of extenuating circumstance:</p>

<p>"There is money in it."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At the time of the Reformation, Glasgow was
but an insignificant little town with five thousand
inhabitants. At the commencement of this century
it contained about eight thousand. To-day it is
the most important city of Scotland, a city which
holds, including the suburbs, very nearly a million
souls, tortured by the passion for wealth or by
misery and hunger.</p>

<p>If the importance of the place is recent, the
place itself dates back more than thirteen
centuries. It was indeed in 560 that Saint
Mungo founded a bishopric there, and no doubt,
to try the faith of Donald, whom he had just
converted to Christianity, he said to him, as he
put an umbrella into his hands with strict injunctions
never to part with it:</p>

<p>"For thy sins, Donald, here shalt thou dwell."</p>

<p>Glasgow is the home of iron and coal. Coal
underground, coal in the air, coal on people's
faces, coal everywhere!</p>

<p>There rise thousands of high chimneys, vomiting
flames and great clouds of smoke, which settle
down on the town and, mixing with the humidity
of the streets, form a black, sticky mud that clogs
your footsteps. No one thinks of wearing elastic-<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 146]</span>side
boots. They would go home with naked feet
if they did. Glasgow people wear carmen's boots,
strongly fastened on with leather laces.</p>

<p>I assure you that if you were to fall in the
street, you would leave your overcoat behind
when you got up.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The neighbourhood of the sea and the Clyde
has been, and still is, a source of prosperity and
opulence to the town; and here it behoves me to
speak of the Scotch energy, which has made of
this stream a river capable of giving anchorage to
vessels drawing twenty-four feet of water.</p>

<p>In 1769, the illustrious James Watt was directed
to examine the river. At that time small craft
could scarcely enter the river even at high water.
Watt indeed found that, at low tide, the rivulet&mdash;for
it was nothing else&mdash;had but a depth of one
foot two inches, and at high tide never more than
three feet three inches.</p>

<p>To-day you may see the largest ironclads afloat
there. This gigantic enterprise cost no less than
&pound;10,300,000.</p>

<p>It was on the Clyde that Henry Bell, in 1812,
launched the first steamboat. Since then the
banks of the Clyde have been lined with vast
shipbuilding yards, which turn out from four to
five hundred vessels a year.</p>

<p>Glasgow always had a taste for smoke. Before
the war of American Independence, this town<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 147]</span>
had the monopoly of the tobacco commerce.
Colossal fortunes were realised over the importation
of the Virginian weed in the end of the
last century. At present Glasgow trades in coal,
machinery, iron goods, printed calico, etc.</p>

<p>The Glasgow man has been influenced by his
surroundings. The climate is dull and damp, the
man is obstinate and laborious; the ground contains
coal and iron for the Clyde to carry to sea,
and so the man is a trader.</p>

<p>And, indeed, what is there to be done in Glasgow
but work? Out-of-door life is interdicted, so to
speak; gaiety is out of the question; everything
predisposes to industry and thought. People
divide their time between work and prayer, the
kirk and the counting-house; such is life in
Glasgow.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And now let us take a stroll, or rather let us
walk, for a stroll implies pleasure, and I certainly
cannot promise you that.</p>

<p>The most striking feature of Glasgow is George
Square. It is large, and literally crowded with
statues, a regular carnival. It looks as if the
Glasgow folks had said: "We must have some
statues, but do not, for all that, let us encumber
the streets with them; let us keep them out of the
way in a place to themselves. If a visitor likes to
go and look at them, much good may it do him."
At a certain distance the effect is that of a<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 148]</span>
cemetery, or picture to yourself Madame Tussaud's
exhibition <i>&agrave; la belle &eacute;toile</i>.</p>

<p>When I say <i>&agrave; la belle &eacute;toile</i>, it is but a figure of
speech in Glasgow.</p>

<p>In this exhibition of sculpture, I discover Walter
Scott, Robert Burns, David Livingstone, James
Watt, Prince Albert, Queen Victoria, Thomas
Campbell, and Sir Robert Peel. Some are on
foot, some on horseback. There are none driving,
but there is Scott who, in the centre of this Kensal
Green, is perched on the summit of a column
eighty feet high. It is enough to make the tallest
chimney of the neighbourhood topple over with
envy. By dint of a little squeezing, it would be
easy to make room for a dozen more statues.</p>

<p>In Queen's Street, quite close to George Square,
we find the Royal Exchange&mdash;an elegant building
in the Corinthian style&mdash;in front of which stands
an equestrian statue of gigantic dimensions.</p>

<p>It is Wellington&mdash;the inevitable, the eternal, the
everlasting Wellington.</p>

<p>Oh, what a bore that Wellington is!</p>

<p>This statue was erected at the expense of the
town for a sum of &pound;10,000.</p>

<p>Wellington will never know what he has cost
his compatriots.</p>

<p>Let us go up George Street, turn to the left by
High Street, towards the north-east, and we shall
come to the Cathedral, the only one which the
fanatic vandalism of the Puritans spared. I was
told in Scotland that this is how it escaped. The<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 149]</span>
Puritans had come to Glasgow in 1567 to destroy
the Cathedral of Saint Mungo. But a gardener,
a practical Scot of the neighbourhood, reasoned
with them in the following manner:</p>

<p>"My friends, you are come with the meritorious
intention of destroying this temple of popery.
But why destroy the edifice? It will cost a mint
of money to build such another. Could not you
use this one and worship God in it after our own
manner?"</p>

<p>The Puritans, who were Scots too, saw the
force of the argument and the cathedral was
saved.</p>

<p>The edifice is gothic, and very handsome. I
recommend especially the crypt, under the choir.
The windows are most remarkable.</p>

<p>Around the cathedral is a graveyard containing
fine monuments. I read on a tablet, put up in
commemoration of the execution of nine covenanters
(1666-1684) the following inscription,
which shows once more how they forgive in
Scotland. Here is the hint to the persecutors:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"<i>They'll know at resurrection day<br />
To murder saints was no sweet play.</i>"<br />
</p></div>

<p>Let us return down High Street as far as Argyle
Street, the great artery of Glasgow.</p>

<p>After a few minutes' walking, we come to
Buchanan Street, the fashionable street of Glasgow&mdash;I
mean the one which contains the fashionable
shops, the Regent Street of this great<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 150]</span>
manufacturing city. The houses are well-built,
I do not say tastefully, but solidly. This might
be said indeed of the whole town: it is dirty, but
substantial. Let us push on to Sanchyhall Street,
and there turn to the west. We presently come
to the park of Kelvingrove, undulating, well laid
out, and surrounded with pretty houses: it is the
only part of Glasgow which does not give you
cold shivers. Among the well-kept paths, flowerbeds,
and ponds, you forget the coal-smoke for
awhile. At the end of the park runs the Kelvin, a
little stream which you cross to get to Gilmore
Hill, on the summit of which stand the buildings
of the university. The interior of these buildings
is magnificent.</p>

<p>The Bute Hall is one of the finest halls I ever
saw: 108 feet long, 75 broad, and 70 high. A
splendid library and all the comfortable accessories,
which they are careful to supply studious
youth with in this country. The university cost
more than half-a-million. With the exception of
a few other parks&mdash;which, however, cannot be
compared to those of London&mdash;there is nothing
more to be seen in Glasgow, and if your business
is transacted, go to your hotel, strap your luggage,
and be off.</p>

<p>But if you prefer it, we will arm ourselves with
umbrellas and return to the streets, and see what
kind of people are to be met there.</p>

<p>That which strikes one at a first visit, is that
from five in the afternoon almost every respectable-<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 151]</span>looking
person has disappeared, and the town
seems given over to the populace. Like the City
proper in London, Glasgow is only occupied by
the superior classes during business hours. From
four to five o'clock there is a general stampede
towards the railway stations. The <i>employ&eacute;</i>, who
earns two or three hundred a year, has his villa or
cottage in the suburbs. The rich merchant, the
engineer, the ironmaster, all these live far from the
city.</p>

<p>The streets of Glasgow, from six or seven in the
evening, are entirely given up to the manufacturing
population&mdash;the dirtiest and roughest to be seen
anywhere, I should think.</p>

<p>I have seen poverty and vice in Paris, in
London, in Dublin, and Brussels, but they are
nothing to compare to the spectacle that Glasgow
presents. It is the living illustration of some unwritten
page of Dante.</p>

<p>"But there is money in Glasgow."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The lower-class women of London do wear a
semblance of a toilette: fur mantles in rags,
battered, greasy hats with faded flowers, flounced
skirts in tatters&mdash;an apology for a costume, in
short.</p>

<p>But here, there is nothing of all that. No
finery, not even a hat. The tartan seems to take
the place of all.</p>

<p>The attributions of this tartan are multiple. It<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 152]</span>
is as useful to the women of the lower classes in
the great Scotch towns as the reindeer is to the
Laplander.</p>

<p>This tartan serves them as a hood when it is
cold; as an umbrella when it rains; as a blanket
in winter nights; as a mattress in summer ones;
as a basket when they go to market; a towel when
they do their own and their children's dry-polishing;
a cradle for their babies, which they carry
either slung over their back, Hottentot fashion, or
hanging in front, like the kangaroos. When
poverty presses hard, the tartan goes to the
pawnbroker's shop, whence it issues in the form
of a sixpence or a shilling, according to its value.
After living in them they live on them, and so
these useful servants pass from external to internal
use, and appease the hunger or thirst of their
owners for a day or two. A very godsend this
tartan, as you see.</p>

<p>A Glasgow police inspector told me that, having
one day to make a search at a pawnbroker's in the
town, he had found more than fifteen hundred of
these shawls on the premises. "Many of those
poor borrowers are Irish," he said. Did he say
this to pass on to a neighbour that which seemed
to him a disgrace to his own country? In any
case, it is a fact that there are a great number of
Irish in Glasgow.</p>

<p>No doubt poverty, with its accompaniments of
shame and vice, exists in all great cities; but here
it has a distressing aspect that it presents in no<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 153]</span>
other country. The Arab beggar makes one
smile as he majestically drapes around him his
picturesque, multicoloured rags; the lazzarone,
lying on the quay of Naples under the radiant
Italian sky, is a prince compared to the wretch
who drags out his existence in the dirty streets or
garrets of Glasgow.</p>

<p>"But there is money in Glasgow."</p>

<p>In Paris, the newspapers are sold in shops or
pretty kiosks kept by clean, tidy, respectable
women. In London and other large English
towns, the papers are cried in the streets by low-class
men and boys. In Glasgow and Edinburgh
the work is done by ragged children, who literally
besiege you as you walk the streets: poor little
girls half-naked, shivering, and starving, with
their feet in the mud, try to earn a few pence to
appease their own hunger, or, perhaps, furnish an
unnatural parent with the means of getting tipsy.
Others have a little stock of matches that they
look at with an envious eye, one fancies, as one
thinks of Andersen's touching tale.</p>

<p>Oh, pity for the poor little children!</p>

<p>In a country so Christian, so philanthropic, can
it be that childhood is abandoned thus? Asylums
for the aged are to be seen in plenty, and is not
youth still more interesting than age, and must it
needs commit some crime before it has the right to
enter some house of refuge?</p>

<p>I cannot tell you how sad the sight of those poor
little beings, forsaken of God and man, made me feel.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>But how shall I describe my feelings when,
having drawn the attention of a Scotchman who
was with me to one of these pitiful little creatures,
I heard him say:</p>

<p>"Do not stop, the immorality of those children
is awful."</p>

<p>No, it is not possible; it must be a bad dream,
a hideous nightmare.</p>

<p>"It is a fact," said my companion, who knows
Glasgow as he knows himself.</p>

<p>"But there is money in it."</p>

<p>It seems incomprehensible that these children
should not be reclaimed, still more incomprehensible
that no one seeks to do it. The money
spent in statues of Wellington would more than
suffice, and the Iron Duke would be none the
worse off in Paradise.</p>

<p>Yes, this is what may be seen in Glasgow, in
that city so pious, that to calm the feelings of
some of the inhabitants, the literary and scientific
lectures which used to be given to the people on
Sunday evenings in Saint Andrew's Hall have had
to be discontinued.</p>

<p>Heaven be thanked, Glasgow is not Scotland,
and we can go and rejoice our eyes in Edinburgh,
Aberdeen, Braemar, and elsewhere, and admire
the lakes and the blue mountains.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 155]</span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 68px;">
<img src="images/capa.jpg" width="68" height="80" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><p class="dropcap">&nbsp; railway journey of an hour and ten
minutes transports you from darkness
into light. You leave Glasgow in gloom,
wrapped in its eternal winding-sheet of fog and
mud, and you arrive at Edinburgh to find clean
streets, pure air, and a clear beautiful sky. Such
at least was my own experience, six times repeated.
The prospect delights the eyes and heart; your
lungs begin to do their work easily; you breathe
freely once more, and once more feel glad to be
alive.</p>

<p>You alight at Waverley Station in the centre of
the city. You cannot do better than go straightway
and take up your quarters at the Royal Hotel,
Princes Street, opposite the gigantic Gothic monument
erected to Walter Scott. Ask for a room
looking on the street. Take possession of it with<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 156]</span>out
delay, and open your window: the sight that
will meet your gaze is truly enchanting. At your
feet, the most elegant street imaginable. No
houses opposite: only large gardens, beautifully
kept, sloping gracefully away to the bottom of a
valley, whence the ground rises almost perpendicularly,
bearing on its summit houses of a prodigious
height. It is the old town of Edinburgh,
where everything will bring back memories of
Mary Stuart and the novels of Scott. On the
right the famous castle perched on a sheer rock
nearly four hundred feet high; the whole bathed
in a blue-grey haze that forms a light veil to soften
its colouring and contour. It is impossible to
imagine a more romantic sight in the midst of a
large modern city.</p>

<p>Whether your tastes be arch&aelig;ological or artistic,
you will be able to satisfy them in one of the two
towns of Edinburgh, the old city to the south, or
the modern town to the north.</p>

<p>The Glasgow folks say there is not much money
made in Edinburgh, and speak of the place with a
certain contempt, which the Edinburgh people
return with interest.</p>

<p>It is always amusing to hear the dwellers in
neighbouring towns run each other down: Manchester
and Liverpool, Brighton and Hastings.
The nearer the rival towns are to each other, the
livelier and more diverting is the jealousy. Go
and ask a Saint-Malo man what he thinks of
Saint-Servan, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>!<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>"Ah! you are going to Edinburgh," the Glasgow
people say to you; "it is full of snobs, who give
themselves airs and are as poor as Job. Ours is
a substantial place, sir. We've no time to waste
on nonsense here; we go in for commerce and
manufactures."</p>

<p>"Ah! you have just come from Glasgow," say
the Edinburgh people. "What do you think of
the illiterate parvenus that are for ever rattling
their money bags? You will find no worship of
the golden calf here; we cultivate the beautiful,
and go in for science and literature, not manufactures;
our town is essentially one of learning."</p>

<p>This is true. Edinburgh is one of the most
important intellectual centres of the world, and
its celebrated university, and learned societies,
have justly earned for it the appellation of "the
Athens of the North," a name which this unique
city deserves also on account of its natural
features, the style in which it is built, and the
numerous monuments it possesses.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Edinburgh has a population of 350,000 inhabitants,
including the sentry at Holyrood Palace.</p>

<p>According to d'Anville, the city stands on the site
of the Roman station of Alata Castra. Towards
the year 626 the fortress became the residence of
Edwin, King of Northumbria, who gave it his
name.</p>

<p>The old city was entirely destroyed by fire in<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 158]</span>
1537. That which now bears the name of <i>old town</i>
dates from the end of the sixteenth century and
the beginning of the seventeenth.</p>

<p>The modern part of Edinburgh was begun at
the close of last century, and the handsomest
streets are of a quite recent date.</p>

<p><i>A tout seigneur tout honneur.</i> Let us commence
our inspection by a visit to Holyrood Palace.</p>

<p>I should like to transform this little volume into
a guide-book, and give you the history of all the
houses we are passing, as we go through the old
town, for almost every one has its history. There
on your left is the house of John Knox, with its
flight of steps, its overhanging stories, and, over
the door, the inscription, "Love God above all,
and your neighbour as yourself." Here is the
house where Cromwell decided on the execution
of Charles I.; there Hume and Smollett wrote
history.</p>

<p>At the end of Canongate, the prolongation of
High Street, we come out on a large open square.
The palace of Holyrood is before us.</p>

<p>Standing in a hollow, and surrounded by high
hills, the aspect of the palace is most sombre.
From the moment you cross the threshold, a
thousand sad thoughts assail you. You are in the
home of Mary Stuart. Everything speaks to you
of her. Her sweet, tragic face, her noble presence,
her thoughtful brow&mdash;you see all again in these
halls instinct with her souvenir. They haunt the
place as they still haunt the memory of the Scotch.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 159]</span>
In spite of her bigotry, in spite of all the crimes
historians have imputed to her, the Scotch cherish
her memory, think only of her misfortunes and
sufferings, and will not hear you speak of her with
anything but respect. One may easily imagine
the ascendency which this woman must have had
over those who came in contact with her.</p>

<p>But let us go in, and first we must get our sixpences
ready; for in this country, where <i>l'hospitalit&eacute;
se donne</i>, you must pay everywhere, and on entering
too, for fear you may not be pleased when
you come out: <i>to avoid misunderstandings</i>, as the
Scotch put it.</p>

<p>On the first floor we enter the picture gallery.
It is here that the Scotch peers are elected. The
room contains portraits of the Scottish kings,
from Fergus I. to James VII. At the end of it
we find a door which leads to the apartments
occupied by the unfortunate princess. Small
windows throw a feeble light on the sombre tapestries;
though the day is fine, it is difficult to
distinguish the various objects of furniture. There
is an air of mystery about the place. Poor Mary!
After the gay French court, what a tomb must
this palace have seemed! Between two windows
is a little mirror that must often have reflected
back the image of that beautiful countenance,
stamped with sadness, the fair head that was one
day to roll at the feet of the executioner. Close
by, a portrait which must be a libel on so gracious
an original. At the two extremities of the bed<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 160]</span>room
two little closets&mdash;I had almost said, cells&mdash;formed
in the towers which overhang from the
outside. The one on the left is the dressing-room;
that on the right the supper-room. Near
the latter a door leads to the secret staircase. You
can reconstruct for yourself the scene of the
murder of the favourite Italian secretary, who
paid with his blood for the honour of having now
and then cheered the heart of the queen with his
songs. On the floor of the audience-room you are
shown the stains of the unhappy Rizzio's blood.
It was here, too, that Chastelard, grandson of
Bayard, declared his love to his royal mistress,
whom he had accompanied to Scotland on her departure
from the French court. Poor Chastelard!
he, too, payed with his life for the love which the
enchantress had inspired in him, not for this first
declaration, which was forgiven him, but for a
graver offence, committed at Rossend Castle, of
which I shall have occasion to speak presently.</p>

<p>A visit to Holyrood always leaves a painful impression.
It is the temple of misfortune, and I
can understand Queen Victoria's preference for
the bright breezy Highlands.</p>

<p>On our return through Canongate and High
Street, we shall come to the Castle. Without
going much out of our way, we can go and see the
Parliament House and the University; but first,
let us go to the summit of Arthur's Seat, a hill
eight hundred and twenty-two feet high, situated
behind the Palace of Holyrood. The ascent is<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 161]</span>
not difficult, and the magnificence of the panorama
that meets the eyes is beyond description.</p>

<p>The House where the Scotch Parliament met
before the union of the Scotch and English Crowns,
is now transformed into Courts of Law. This
building is interesting not only on account of the
souvenirs it evokes, but also on account of the
hopes it keeps alive in the hearts of the Scotch.
Before many years have elapsed, the representatives
of Scotland will probably sit there to
manage the local affairs of the nation.</p>

<p>Edinburgh University, which dates from the
year 1582, is the finest edifice of the kind in
Europe: two hundred and fifty-five feet long, by
three hundred and fifty-eight broad. A library of
one hundred and fifty thousand volumes (sixpence
entrance). Rare manuscripts. Magnificent lecture
rooms. Over three thousand students work
under most eminent professors.</p>

<p>Facing the University is the Museum of Arts and
Science. For a list of the innumerable treasures
it contains, I must refer the reader to guides to
Scotland.</p>

<p>The Royal Infirmary, with its numerous buildings,
in the midst of which rises a tower thirty-three
feet high, arrests our attention a few moments.
From here we can turn down High Street to
admire the Cathedral of Saint Giles, so full of
souvenirs of the Reformation, and then continue
our course up the great street of the old city, as
far as the famous Edinburgh Castle, a feudal<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 162]</span>
edifice standing on the summit of a perpendicular
rock, from whence you can survey the old and
new towns.</p>

<p>The Crown Room contains the insignia of the
Scottish sovereigns. Close to it is the room where
Mary Stuart gave birth to the son who was to
unite the crowns of England and Scotland. In
this rapid glimpse of Edinburgh, it would be out
of place to enter into all the history of the Castle,
the sieges it has stood, and so on. Historical
castles all resemble each other a little; but that
which makes the interest of this one unique is its
marvellous position: the sixteenth century at your
right; the hills and the sea beyond; on your left,
the parks; in front, nearly four hundred feet
below you, the beautiful modern town, with its
elegant buildings, straight, wide streets, and its
statues; a little in the distance, Calton Hill, with
its Greek monuments; beyond again, Leith with
its harbour bristling with masts; you are chained
to the spot in admiration.</p>

<p>Following the castle terrace, we will descend
towards the new town, and come out at the west
of Princes Street.</p>

<p>We are walking towards the East. On our
left, we shall have the shops; on our right, the
public gardens, a mixture of <i>Boulevard des Italiens</i>
and <i>Champs Elys&eacute;es</i>. Everything here is in perfect
taste. Look at the statues judiciously placed about
the public gardens, streets, and squares!</p>

<p>O George Square!<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>Here is a shop-window full of photographs. Let
us stop and look in: they are not portraits of
actresses and fashionable beauties, but chiefly of
professors of the University, of which Edinburgh
is so proud. Remarkable among them is Professor
Blackie, his fine head recalling a likeness of
Lizst. It was this same Professor Blackie on
whom the people of Glasgow made such an attack
about two years ago, for having given, one Sunday
in Saint Andrew's Hall, a most charming and
poetical discourse on the Songs of Scotland.</p>

<p>The sweep of the public gardens on the right is
agreeably broken by two specimens of the most
elegant Greek architecture: they are the buildings
of the Royal Institution and the National Gallery.
Nothing could be more graceful, more Attic, than
these twin structures. The first contains thousands
of national relics, from the pulpit of Knox to the
Ribbon of the Garter worn by Prince Charles
Stuart. The second is an admirable museum of
painting and sculpture.</p>

<p>The most striking monument of Princes Street
is the one which was erected to Walter Scott in
1844. It has the form of a Gothic steeple, and is
not less than two hundred feet high. It resembles
somewhat the Albert Memorial in Hyde Park, but
with this difference, that, while designed with ten
times as much taste, it cost about a tenth of the
money. The novelist's heroes and heroines are
gracefully placed in the niches; the author himself
is seated in an attitude of contemplation in<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 164]</span>
the midst of his creations. Now for the comic
side of the thing. A staircase conducts to the
summit of the monument, to which you may
mount for the sum of twopence.</p>

<p>On the East of Princes Street are two very
fine buildings&mdash;the Post Office and the Register
Office, or resting-place of the national archives.
This latter building has a magnificent flight of
steps, in front of which is an equestrian statue&mdash;you
guess whose, of course: the inevitable, the
eternal, the never-to-be-sufficiently-paraded.</p>

<p>What a bore that creature is!</p>

<p>I am quite willing to admit that Wellington did
exist, and that he rendered his country service;
but is that a reason for turning him into a bore?
He is a very nightmare!</p>

<p>Napoleon, surely, was as great a general as
Wellington. We have placed him on the top of
the Vendome Column, but we had the good taste
not to stick him up in every provincial city.</p>

<p>That is true, you will perhaps say; but Wellington
saved his country, whereas Napoleon ruined
his. That is not my opinion; but we will not
argue.</p>

<p>Joan of Arc saved France. We have her statue
at Domr&eacute;my, where she was born; at Orleans,
where she handed over to her king his kingdom;
and at Rouen, where she suffered death.</p>

<p>I should understand every Scotch town having
a statue of Burns, and another of Scott. These
two geniuses personify Scotland; they remind the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 165]</span>
Scotch that Scotland is a nation, with a literature
of her own; they keep up patriotism in every
heart. But what did Wellington do for Scotland?
If, in 1840, for instance, the Scotch had asked the
English to give them their national rights and
their parliament, Wellington is probably the
general who would have gone to reduce them to
order.</p>

<p>But let us say no more about it. We will continue
our walk to the end of Princes Street.
Here we are at the foot of Calton Hill. By means
of flights of steps and paths we pass the Observatory,
and reach the top, to see the monument
erected to Nelson's memory (threepence entrance).</p>

<p>Between this monument and the Observatory,
there stands a reproduction of the Parthenon.
This is what chiefly suggested the idea of calling
Edinburgh the Athens of the North. Calton Hill
does its best to play the part of the Acropolis.
But, unhappily, this Parthenon, built to commemorate
the victory of Waterloo, remains unfinished
for want of funds. It is true that this
lends it a ruined look, which does not give a bad
effect to the scene. But &pound;20,000 to make a ruin
is dear. In that time the Greeks would have sold
the Scots the real Parthenon for half the money.
Half the money! What am I talking about? for
a timepiece. Go to the British Museum and see
what Lord Elgin got for a clock: the marbles and
frieze of the Parthenon, the bas-reliefs of Phidias,
columns from the temple of Diana at Ephesus, the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 166]</span>
epitaph of the Athenians who died at Potid&#339;a,
the bas-reliefs of the temple of &AElig;gina. Lord
Elgin was a business-like Scotchman. In 1816
the English bought his collection of him for
&pound;36,000. They would not sell it to-day for
&pound;500,000.</p>

<p>Going round the Acropolis we will descend near
the High School, the most important school in
Edinburgh, opposite which stands the monument
to Robert Burns (twopence entrance). It is rather
insignificant-looking, and reminds one of that
erected by the Athenians in memory of Lysicrates.
Cost, &pound;2,600.</p>

<p>I pass over many museums and institutions;
but I hope I have succeeded in showing that
Edinburgh is a place to be seen, and quite repays
one for the trouble of a long journey.</p>

<p>And now let us see what kind of people one
meets in the streets of Edinburgh. After that, I
will ask your permission to take you across the
Firth of Forth, and show you a castle little known
in England, where I hope we shall be able to pass
a little time pleasantly.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 167]</span></p>

</div><p class="dropcap">ith the exception of the famous
tartan shawls, which we come across
again in Edinburgh on the backs of
the lower-class women, nothing in the costume
of the inhabitants could remind you that you
were not in Paris, London, Brussels, or any
other haunt of that badge of modern civilisation,
the chimney-pot. In Glasgow this does not shock
you more than it would in Manchester or Birmingham;
but, in the romantic city of Edinburgh,
even the whistle of the railway engine annoys
you; the cap and kilt are sadly felt wanting, and
you almost want to stop the passers-by and ask
them: "Where are your kilts?" You feel as if
you were cheated out of something.</p>

<p>Alas! the national costume of the Scotch is
almost a thing of the past: it is no longer a dress&mdash;it
is a get-up.</p>

<p>You may see it yet at fancy dress balls, in the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 168]</span>
army of Her Britannic Majesty, at the Paris
Opera-Comique, and in the comic papers.</p>

<p>I believe the Royal Princes occasionally don it,
when they go to Scotland in the autumn to shoot;
but even in the remote Highlands the national
costume is dying out, and if you count upon seeing
Scotchmen, dressed Scotch fashion in Scotland,
you will be disappointed. As well look for lions
in the outskirts of Algiers, or a pretty woman in
the streets of Berne.</p>

<p>A gentleman in kilts would make as great a
sensation in the streets of Edinburgh as he would
on the Boulevard des Italiens. Nay, more, if he
stood still, he might have pence offered him.</p>

<p>The costume of <i>Dickson</i> in <i>La Dame Blanche</i> is
only seen on the backs of those splendid Highlanders
whom the maidservants in large towns
hire by the afternoon on Sundays to accompany
them to the parks.</p>

<p>In London you will sometimes see Highlanders&mdash;from
Whitechapel&mdash;playing the bagpipes and
dancing reels, talents which bring an ample harvest
of pennies in populous neighbourhoods, but
which would fall rather flat in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>I cannot imagine anything much more picturesque
than Princes Street at night, when the old
city in amphitheatre-shape, on the other side of
the valley, stands out from the sky which it seems
to touch with its old sombre majestic castle, and
its houses ten or twelve stories high, rising tier
above tier up the side of the hill, and shining with<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 169]</span>
a thousand lights. I can understand that the inhabitants
of Edinburgh enjoy to come out in the
evening and feast their eyes on the enchanting
sight, and this even in winter, when the street is a
very funnel for the east wind which blows across
straight from the Scandinavian icebergs.</p>

<p>Edinburgh is the only town in Great Britain,
which I have visited, whose streets are not shunned
by respectable people at night.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A fine road about two miles long leads to Leith,
which stands for Pir&aelig;us to the Scotch Athens.
There, in the mud and smoke, dwells a population
of sixty thousand toil-stained folk, who contrast
strongly with their elegant neighbours of Edinburgh.
There is nothing here to attract the eye
of the traveller, unless it be the harbour with its
two piers&mdash;one 3,530, the other 3,123 feet long&mdash;where
the inhabitants can go and breathe the sea
air, away from the noise and smoke of the town.</p>

<p>Along the coast to the west, two miles from
Leith, we come upon the interesting village of
Newhaven. Here we find a little world apart,
composed of fisherfolk, all related one to another,
it is said. They treat as Philistines all who did not
first see the light in their sanctuary, and the
result is that they are constantly intermarrying.
All the men work at fishing. The women go to
Edinburgh to sell what their husbands catch, and
bring back empty baskets and full pockets. These<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 170]</span>
worthy women would think they were robbing
their dear village if they bought the least thing in
Edinburgh. Needless to say, the little community
prospers. To see the costume of the women, who,
in no point imitate the ridiculous get-up of their
sisters in great towns; to see the activity and zeal
for their work, one would believe oneself in France.</p>

<p>"All the skippers own their own boats, and the
pretty little houses they live in," said the Scotchman
who accompanied me.</p>

<p>And how neat and clean they look, those little
white houses covered with climbing plants of all
sorts! The whole scene speaks loudly of the
work, thrift, and order of the people.</p>

<p>By pushing on two miles further we come to
Granton. There we can take the boat which will
carry us over the Firth of Forth, and set us down
at Burntisland in Fifeshire; but instead of there
taking the train to the north of Scotland, we will
stop to see Rossend Castle.</p>

<p>Standing on a promontory, which dominates the
Firth of Forth and the hills of Edinburgh, Rossend
Castle is one of the most romantic places in
Scotland.</p>

<p>Its old square tower contains the bedroom
used by Mary Stuart when she travelled in Fifeshire,
and stopped at the castle. The present
owner, whose hospitality is proverbial in the
neighbourhood, has religiously preserved the room
intact. It is there just as it existed three hundred
years ago, with its two little turret-rooms, oak<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 171]</span>
wainscoting, and a thousand relics of its unhappy
visitor.</p>

<p>The portrait of Mary Stuart at Rossend is the
most striking that I saw in Scotland. Placed
over the mantelpiece, it seems to fill the room
with its dreamy melancholy gaze. It seems to
follow you, and you cannot take your eyes off it.
I occupied this room for four nights, a prey to
the saddest thoughts. It was in the month of
January, and the wind, which was blowing hard
across the Firth, roared round the tower. With
my feet before the fire, which burned in the immense
fireplace, I let my fancy reconstruct the
scene in which poor Chastelard lost his head, first
figuratively, and then in reality.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in the preceding chapter, my
young and handsome countryman Pierre de Boscosel
de Chastelard had conceived a mad passion
for the queen. He had dared to declare this love
in the Holyrood Palace. His offence was forgiven.</p>

<p>Imagining, from the fact of his having been
pardoned, that he had succeeded in inspiring
affection in the heart of his royal mistress, the
poor moth must needs flutter again around the
flame, which was to be his destruction. The
romantic troubadour secretly followed the queen
from Edinburgh to Rossend Castle, and, on the
night of the 14th of February, 1562, hid himself in
her chamber, until she was almost undressed for
the night, when he left his hiding-place, and,
seizing the queen in his arms, so alarmed her, that<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 172]</span>
she screamed for protection. This woman who,
to avenge Rizzio's death, did not hesitate to have
a barrel of powder placed under her husband's
bed, felt herself insulted. Her cries attracted her
attendants, and Murray was ordered by the indignant
queen to stab the young madman dead
then and there. But Murray preferred to wreak
his wrath on Chastelard, whom he hated, by
having him hanged. The poor secretary, who
had been so favoured by his mistress that all the
courtiers were jealous of him, who had so often
beguiled her solitude by his poems and his music,
went cheerfully to the scaffold. Like Cornelius
de Witt, who, a century later, recited Horace's
<i>Justum et tenacem</i> while the executioner of The
Hague put him to the torture, Chastelard mounted
the scaffold calm and smiling, reciting Rousard's
<i>Ode to Love</i>.</p>

<p>"I die not without reproach, like my ancestor
Bayard," said he; "but, like him, I die without
fear."</p>

<p>And then, turning his eyes towards the castle
inhabited by Mary Stuart, he cried:</p>

<p>"Adieu, thou cruel but beautiful one, who
killest me, but whom I cannot cease to love!"</p>

<p>Rossend Castle is a veritable poem in stone.
Do not visit Edinburgh without pushing to Burntisland.
The <i>ch&acirc;telain</i> is justly proud of his romantic
home, and does the honours of it with a kind
grace that charms the visitor.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 173]</span></p>

</div><p class="dropcap">t does not enter into the plan of this book to
give a detailed description of the principal
towns and sites in Scotland. That can be
found in any guide-book.</p>

<p>The aim of this little volume is to give an idea
of the character and customs of the Scotch, from
<i>Souvenirs</i> of several visits made by the author to
the land of Burns and Scott.</p>

<p>But a few words must be said on the subject of
the City of Granite.</p>

<p>Aberdeen is a large, clean-looking town, with
more than a hundred thousand inhabitants; wide,
regular streets, fine edifices, and many statues,
among which we are happy, for a change, not to
find that of <i>you know whom</i>.</p>

<p>If Glasgow and Dundee are the principal
centres of commercial activity in Scotland, Edinburgh
and Aberdeen are the two great centres of
learning.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>Union Street, the principal thoroughfare, is
about half-a-mile long, and is built entirely of
light grey granite, which gives it a rather
monotonous aspect. Public buildings, churches,
private houses, pavements, all are grey; the
inhabitants are mostly dressed in grey, and look
where you will, you seem to see nothing but
grey.</p>

<p>Just as it is in London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow,
the fashionable quarter is the west, and the
poor live in the east.</p>

<p>Is this due to chance?</p>

<p>The most conspicuous edifice of the town is the
Municipal Building, forming a town hall and a
court of justice. The most interesting is Marischal
College, the home of the Faculty and School of
Medicine, which now form part of the University
of Aberdeen, after having had a separate existence
for two hundred and sixty-six years. The college
is a very fine building, but is unfortunately hemmed
in by a number of other buildings which hide its
<i>fa&ccedil;ade</i>.</p>

<p>A mile from the town stands the college of the
university (King's College), built in 1495 on the
model of the Paris university. Most of the Scotch
buildings, which date from the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries, have a very pronounced French
character.</p>

<p>I would advise tourists, who go as far north as
Aberdeen, not to miss making the ascension of the
Blue Hill, which is about four miles from the town.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 175]</span>
From the summit of this hill, they will see a
delightful panorama of Aberdeen, a stretch of
fifty or sixty miles of coast, the ruins of the
celebrated castle of Dunnottar, and all the valley
of the Dee framed in hills. It is a grand
sight; unfortunately, to thoroughly bring out its
beauties, a clear sky is essential, and there comes
the rub.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The county of Aberdeen is not only one of
the great intellectual centres of Scotland, it
is the home of Caledonian shrewdness and
pawkiness. Aberdeenshire alone furnished more
than half the anecdotes collected by Dean
Ramsay.</p>

<p>The Aberdonians are the chosen people, the
elect of God.</p>

<p>Every Scot is proud of his nationality, but an
Aberdonian will tell you: "Not only am I a
Scotchman, but I was born in Aberdeen."</p>

<p>And true enough, "tak' awa' Aberdeen, and
twal' miles round, and faar are ye?"</p>

<p>It is related that a provost of Aberdeen, having
come to London with his wife, someone recommended
the lady to be sure and go to Covent
Garden to see the opera.</p>

<p>"No," she replied, "we have come to London
to be quiet and not to receive ovations. We shall
not show ourselves in public during our stay in the
capital."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>Her resolution was adhered to, and London
saw them not.</p>

<p>For the future life, the Aberdonian has no fears,
and if he will only recommend you to Saint Peter,
you will not have to wait long at the gates of
Paradise.</p>

<p>Society in Aberdeen is of the choicest. Its
aristocracy is an aristocracy of talent. In Aberdeen,
as in Edinburgh, the local lions are the
professors of the university, literary people,
doctors, barristers, and artists. To cut a figure
there, you need not jingle your guineas, but only
show your brains and good manners. In Glasgow,
show your <i>savoir-faire</i>; but, in Edinburgh and
Aberdeen, your <i>savoir-vivre</i>.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I cannot quit the subject of Aberdeen without
relating a little incident which exceedingly diverted
me.</p>

<p>A few hours before delivering a lecture at the
Albert Hall, I paid a visit to the place to see if
my reading-desk had been properly arranged.
Great was my surprise, on entering the hall, to
see near the platform an elegant improvised green-room,
curtained off. I asked the caretaker if there
was not a retiring-room, in which I could await
the moment for beginning my lecture, to which he
replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; we have an anteroom over there, but
I have set apart this little green-room, because I<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 177]</span>
thought it would be more comfortable for you to
go and change your dresses in during the performance."</p>

<p>The worthy fellow evidently imagined that I
was going to appear in tights before the lairds of
Aberdeen.</p>

<p>The learned professor, who had kindly come to
introduce me to my audience, laughed heartily
with me over the joke.</p>

<img src="images/capt.jpg" width="70" height="80" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p class="dropcap">he emblem of Scotland is the thistle, the
device <i>Nemo me impune lacessit</i>.</p>

<p>The great Order of Scotland is that of
the Thistle, or Saint Andrew, the patron saint of
the country, and was instituted by James V. in
1534&mdash;that is to say, about two hundred years
after Edward III. of England had founded the
Order of the Garter.</p>

<p><i>A propos</i> of this Garter, what fables and anecdotes
have been written! Historians even are not agreed<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 178]</span>
as to the origin of the famous device: <i>Honi soit qui
mal y pense</i>.</p>

<p>The explanation which seems to be the most
plausible is this:</p>

<p>The Countess of Salisbury, King Edward
III.'s mistress, dropped her garter at a ball.
The king picked it up; but, as the worthy descendant
of a bashful race, he did not attempt
to replace it, but turning towards his courtiers,
said:</p>

<p>"My lords, <i>honi soit qui mollet pince</i>."</p>

<p>Then he advanced towards the countess and
gave her her garter.</p>

<p>The king's expression became corrupted into:</p>

<p><i>Honi soit qui mal y pense.</i></p>

<p>This is the correct version, you may depend
on it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Scots are a nation of hardy, valiant men,
whom the English never would have succeeded in
conquering by force of arms.</p>

<p>The Scotch will tell you that it was not England
that annexed them, it was they who annexed
England. Let us not grudge them this consolation,
if it gives them any pleasure.</p>

<p>It is a fact that, on the death of Elizabeth,
James VI. of Scotland&mdash;Mary Stuart's son&mdash;was
called to fill the English throne, and thus united
the crowns of England and Scotland.</p>

<p>But these conquering Scots begin to perceive<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 179]</span>
that they are treated rather like conquered Scots
at the Palace of Westminster, and they do not
like it.</p>

<p>"They are very quiet under it," you may say;
"one does not hear them complaining like the
Irish."</p>

<p>That is true: Donald is patient, and knows how
to bide his time.</p>

<p>The Irish question overwhelms every other
political one just now in England. We all know
that the Irish demand Home Rule, and as we do
not hear the Scotch and the Welsh talked of,
we conclude that these two peoples are comfortably
enjoying life under the best of possible
governments.</p>

<p>Scotland and Wales content themselves for the
present with sending Liberal members to the
British Parliament. But with them the word
"Liberal" has not the political sense which
it possesses in England, it has a rather revolutionary
meaning. I do not mean by this that it
implies an idea of rebellion.</p>

<p>No. But in their vocabulary it is almost
synonymous with <i>autonomist</i>.</p>

<p>The English Liberals are men who are convinced
that things are not perfect, and who admit
the possibility of reforms.</p>

<p>In the eyes of the Scotch, Liberalism consists
in preparing to ask one day for a great
reform: Home Rule. Before ten years have
passed, we shall see Scotland and Wales elect<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 180]</span>ing
Home Rule candidates, as Ireland is doing
now.</p>

<p>The Scotch will consent to remain British on
condition that the English allow them to become
Scotch&mdash;that is to say, to manage for themselves
matters which have no connection with the
Empire, and concern the Scotch people alone;
such as religion, education, and the administration
of justice. They are too shrewd to desire to
become once more Scots pure and simple, and so
renounce their part and profit in the gigantic
concern called the British Empire. They will
continue to send members to Westminster to take
part in the work of governing the Empire, but
they will have a parliament or a council at Edinburgh,
whose business it will be to look after
matters purely Scotch.</p>

<p>They would be willing to walk hand-in-hand
with England, but not by means of handcuffs.</p>

<p>The English are fond of talking of Scotland as
if it were a county of England. The Scotch
mean that Scotland shall be Scotland.</p>

<p>"Let the English look after England," they say,
"and we will look after Scotland. As soon as a
question relating to the British Empire arises,
we will be as British as they. We do not want to
destroy the unity of the Empire, or to break off
our relations with the Parliament; but we simply
wish to do as we like at home."</p>

<p>There is nothing extraordinary in such a
demand.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>When the Scotch, or the Irish, win a battle, it
is immediately announced in the papers that "the
English have gained a victory." But let an Irishman
or a Scotchman commit a crime, and John
Bull quickly cries out:</p>

<p>"It is an Irishman," or "It is a Scotchman."</p>

<p>"Let it be each one to himself, and each for
himself," says Donald, "so long as it is a question
of England or Scotland. But when it is a
question of the great Motherland, then we will
all be Britons."</p>

<p>The English have this good point: they know
that it is good policy not to try and prevent the
inevitable, but rather to put a good face upon it.
They know that that which is given ungraciously
is received ungratefully.</p>

<p>They are now administering the eighty-seventh
coercive pill to the Irish. That will be the last.</p>

<p>In two or three years time, Ireland will belong
to the Irish, as, later on, Scotland will belong to
the Scotch.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom will only be the more
powerful for it. Having no more internal
squabbles to fear, it will present a formidable
quadruple breast to the outer world.</p>

<p>London will be the political centre of an
immense imperial federation. England, Scotland,
Ireland, Wales, India, the Cape, Canada, Australia,
all will be represented in a Parliament
really Britannic. Their capitals will be the
respective leaders of this grand team.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>The British Empire will be built upon hearts
in all parts of the globe.</p>

<p>If there is no longer any United Kingdom,
neither will there be a Disunited Kingdom, and
instead there will be something much more imposing,
much more powerful, there will be</p>
